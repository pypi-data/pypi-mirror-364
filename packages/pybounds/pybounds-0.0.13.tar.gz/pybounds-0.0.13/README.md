## Introduction

This repository provides a minimal working example demonstrating how to empirically calculate the observability level of individual states for a nonlinear (partially observable) system, and accounts for sensor noise.

## Installing

The package can be installed by cloning the repo and running python setup.py install from inside the home pybounds directory.

Alternatively using pip
```bash
pip install pybounds
```

## Notebook examples
