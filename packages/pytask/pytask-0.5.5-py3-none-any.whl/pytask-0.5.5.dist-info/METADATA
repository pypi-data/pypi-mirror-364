pytask is a workflow management system that facilitates reproducible data analyses. Its
features include:

- **Automatic discovery of tasks.**
- **Lazy evaluation.** If a task, its dependencies, and its products have not changed,
  do not execute it.
- **Debug mode.**
  [Jump into the debugger](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/debugging.html)
  if a task fails, get feedback quickly, and be more productive.
- **Repeat a task with different inputs.**
  [Loop over task functions](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/repeating_tasks_with_different_inputs.html)
  to run the same task with different inputs.
- **Select tasks via expressions.** Run only a subset of tasks with
  [expressions and marker expressions](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/selecting_tasks.html).
- **Easily extensible with plugins**. pytask is built on
  [pluggy](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a plugin management framework that
  allows you to adjust pytask to your needs. Plugins are available for
  [parallelization](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-parallel),
  [LaTeX](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-latex),
  [R](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-r), and
  [Stata](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-stata) and more can be found
  [here](https://github.com/topics/pytask). Learn more about plugins in
  [this tutorial](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/plugins.html).

# Installation

<!-- Keep in sync with docs/source/tutorials/installation.md -->

pytask is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pytask) and on
[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pytask). Install the package with

```console
$ uv add pytask
```

or

```console
$ pixi add pytask
```

or use pip, conda, or mamba if you like.

Color support is automatically available on non-Windows platforms. On Windows, please,
use [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal), which can be, for
example, installed via the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/terminal).

To quickly set up a new project, use the
[cookiecutter-pytask-project](https://github.com/pytask-dev/cookiecutter-pytask-project)
template or start from
[other templates or example projects](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_to_guides/bp_templates_and_projects.html).

# Usage

A task is a function that is detected if the module and the function name are prefixed
with `task_`. Here is an example.

```python
# Content of task_hello.py.

from pathlib import Path

from pytask import Product
from typing import Annotated


def task_hello_earth(path: Annotated[Path, Product] = Path("hello_earth.txt")):
    path.write_text("Hello, earth!")
```

- The purpose of the task is to create the file `hello_earth.txt` and add some content.

- To tell pytask that `hello_earth.txt` is a product and not an input, use the `Product`
  annotation.

  (If you are not used to type annotations, do not worry. pytask also offers simpler
  interfaces without type annotations.)

- Since you pass a `pathlib.Path` to the function, pytask will check whether the file
  exists after the function is executed.

To execute the task, enter `pytask` on the command-line

# Documentation

You find the documentation <https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable> with
[tutorials](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/index.html) and guides

# Acknowledgment

The license also includes a copyright and permission notice from
[pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) since some modules, classes, and
functions are copied from pytest. Not to mention how pytest has inspired the development
of pytask in general. Without the excellent work of
[Holger Krekel](https://github.com/hpk42) and pytest's many contributors, this project
would not have been possible. Thank you!

pytask owes its beautiful appearance on the command line to

Repeating tasks in loops is inspired by [ward](https://github.com/darrenburns/ward)
