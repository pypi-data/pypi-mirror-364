## Overview
This API manages asynchronous extended data protection (XDP) relationships for FlexVol volumes, FlexGroup volumes, or SVMs. It is also used to manage a synchronous relationship between FlexVol volumes, which provides zero RPO data protection and active synchronous relationship with automated failover between Application Consistency Group endpoints which provides zero RTO data protection.<br/>
To create an asynchronous extended data protection relationship with FlexVol volumes, FlexGroup volumes, Application Consistency Groups or SVMs, use the policy of type "async".<br/>
To create a synchronous relationship between FlexVol volumes, use the policy of type "sync" with sync_type of either "sync" or "strict_sync". To create an active synchronous relationship with automated failover between Application Consistency Group endpoints, use the policy of type "sync" with sync_type "automated_failover". You can create an asynchronous extended data protection relationship between the source and destination which can be used by the transfer APIs to perform SnapMirror "restore" operations.<br/>
To create FlexVol volume or FlexGroup volume SnapMirror relationships, the source volume must be in the "online" state and be a read_write type; the destination volume must be in the "online" state and be a data protection type.<br/>
In the case of an asynchronous or synchronous SnapMirror relationship for an Application Consistency Group of FlexVol volumes, SnapMirror creation results in the creation of an Application Consistency Group on the source cluster if it did not already exist with the exact same name and set of FlexVol volumes specified in the current operation. Additionally, if the specified Application Consistency Group is already present and is already a part of an existing SnapMirror relationship, the process fails. Creating an Application Consistency Group on the destination cluster is part of the SnapMirror creation workflow.<br/>
To create SnapMirror relationships between SVMs, the source SVM must be of subtype "default" and the destination SVM of subtype "dp_destination". Additionally, SVMs must be peered before a relationship can be established between them when the "create_destination" property is not specified. When the "create_destination" property is specified, the destination SVM is provisioned on the destination cluster and the SVM peer relationship is established between the source SVM and the new destination SVM, provided that the source SVM has SVM peering permissions for the destination cluster.<br/>
Data protection FlexVol volume SnapMirror relationships cannot be created using this API but existing relationships can be listed or managed.<br/>
The SnapMirror functionality is subdivided into relationship APIs and transfer APIs:
- SnapMirror relationship APIs are used to create and manage the SnapMirror relationships.
- SnapMirror transfer APIs are used to manage data transfers."""

        r"""Updates a SnapMirror relationship. This API is used to initiate SnapMirror operations such as "initialize", "resync", "break", "quiesce", and "resume" by specifying the appropriate value for the "state" field. It is also used to modify the SnapMirror policy associated with the specified relationship. Additionally, a SnapMirror relationship can be failed over to the destination endpoint or a failed over SnapMirror relationship can be failed back to the original state or a SnapMirror relationship direction can be reversed using this API. This API can also be used to expand the SnapMirror active sync relationship with the specified source and destination volumes.
<br>To initialize the relationship, PATCH the state to "snapmirrored" for relationships with a policy of type "async" or "in_sync" for relationships with a policy of type "sync".
<br>To break the relationship or to failover to the destination endpoint and start serving data from the destination endpoint, PATCH the state to "broken_off" for relationships with a policy of type "async" or "sync". SnapMirror relationships with the policy type as "sync" and sync_type as "automated_failover" cannot be "broken_off".
<br>To resync the broken relationship, PATCH the state to "snapmirrored" for relationships with a policy of type "async" or "in_sync" for relationships with a policy of type "sync".
<br>To failback the failed over relationship and start serving data from the source endpoint, PATCH the state to "snapmirrored" for relationships with a policy of type "async" or "in_sync" for relationships with a policy of type "sync" and set the query flag "failback" as "true". SnapMirror relationships with the policy type as "sync" and sync_type as "automated_failover" can be in "broken_off" state due to a failed attempt of automated SnapMirror failover operation.
<br>To pause the relationship, suspending further transfers, PATCH the state to "paused" for relationships with a policy of type "async" or "sync". SnapMirror relationships with the policy type as "sync" and sync_type as "automated_failover" cannot be "paused".
<br>To resume transfers for a paused relationship, PATCH the state to "snapmirrored" for relationships with a policy of type "async" or "in_sync" for relationships with a policy of type "sync".
<br>To reverse the direction of the relationship, PATCH the "source.path" with the destination endpoint and the "destination.path" with the source endpoint and the relationship state to "snapmirrored" for relationships with a policy of type "async" or "in_sync" for relationships with a policy of type "sync". For relationships with a policy of type "async" and relationship state as "snapmirrored", stop IO on the source endpoint and perform a SnapMirror transfer POST operation before reversing the direction of the relationship to prevent any loss of data.
<br>The values "in_sync", "out_of_sync", and "synchronizing" are only applicable to relationships with a policy of type "sync".
<br>When "transfer_schedule" is specified along with "state" during PATCH, first the schedule is modified on the relationship and then the respective SnapMirror operation is initiated. The "transfer_schedule" specified is used to update asynchronous relationships.
<br>When "throttle" is specified along with "state" during PATCH, first the throttle is modified on the relationship, which will be used by any upcoming transfers and then the respective SnapMirror operation is initiated. If the SnapMirror operation initiated a transfer then it will also use the new throttle. If "throttle" needs to be applied for a specific transfer use SnapMirror Transfer REST API.
<br>For SnapMirror active sync relationships, when "consistency_group_volumes" is specified during PATCH, first the existing FlexVol volume relationship is deleted and released and then the volumes are added to the SnapMirror active sync relationship.

### Examples
### Related ONTAP commands
* `snapmirror modify`
* `snapmirror initialize`
* `snapmirror resync`
* `snapmirror break`
* `snapmirror quiesce`
* `snapmirror resume`
### Important notes
* The property "transfer_schedule" if set on a SnapMirror relationship overrides the "transfer_schedule" set on the policy being used with the SnapMirror relationship.
* The property "throttle" if set on a SnapMirror relationship overrides the "throttle" set on the policy being used with the SnapMirror relationship.
* The properties "transfer_schedule" and "throttle" are not supported when "failback" is set to "true".
* The properties "transfer_schedule" and "throttle" are not supported when "failover" is set to "true".
* The properties "transfer_schedule" and "throttle" are not supported when "force_failover" is set to "true".
* The properties "transfer_schedule" and "throttle" are not supported when the direction of the relationship is being reversed.
* To remove a transfer_schedule on a SnapMirror relationship set the "transfer_schedule" to null (no-quotes) during SnapMirror relationship PATCH.
* The property "identity_preservation" value can be changed from a higher "identity_preservation" threshold value to a lower "identity_preservation" threshold value but not vice-versa. For example, the threshold value of the "identity_preservation" property can be changed from "full" to "exclude_network_config", but cannot be increased from "exclude_network_and_protocol_config" to "exclude_network_config" to "full". The threshold value of the "identity_preservation" cannot be changed to "exclude_network_and_protocol_config" for IDP SVMDR.

* The property "backoff_level" is only applicable for FlexVol SnapMirror relationships.
### Examples
The following examples show how to perform the SnapMirror "resync", "initialize", "resume", "quiesce", and "break" operations. In addition, a relationship can be failed over to the destination endpoint and start serving data from the destination endpoint. A failed over relationship can be failed back to the source endpoint and serve data from the source endpoint. Also a relationship can be reversed by making the source endpoint as the new destination endpoint and the destination endpoint as the new source endpoint.

When the destination endpoint is being provisioned, this API can also be executed from the cluster containing the source endpoint. Provisioning of the destination endpoint from the source cluster is supported for the FlexVol volume, FlexGroup volume and Application Consistency Group endpoints.<br/>
For SVM endpoints, provisioning the destination SVM endpoint is not supported from the source cluster. When the destination endpoint exists, the source SVM and the destination SVM must be in an SVM peer relationship. When provisioning the destination endpoint, the SVM peer relationship between the source SVM and the destination SVM is established as part of the destination provision, provided that the source SVM has SVM peering permissions for the destination cluster.

### Required properties
* `source.path` - Path to the source endpoint of the SnapMirror relationship.
* `destination.path` - Path to the destination endpoint of the SnapMirror relationship.
* `source.consistency_group_volumes` - List of FlexVol volumes of type "RW" that are constituents of an Application Consistency Group.
* `destination.consistency_group_volumes` - List of FlexVol volumes of type "DP" that are constituents of an Application Consistency Group.
### Recommended optional properties
* `policy.name` or `policy.uuid` - Policy governing the SnapMirror relationship.
* `state` - Set the state to "snapmirrored" to automatically initialize the relationship.
* `create_destination.enabled` - Enable this property to provision the destination endpoint.

If not specified in POST, the following default property values are assigned:
* `policy.name` - _Asynchronous_
* `restore` - _false_
* `create_destination.tiering.policy` - `_snapshot_only_` (when `create_destination.tiering.supported` is _true_ for FlexVol volume)
* `create_destination.tiering.policy` - `_none_` (when `create_destination.tiering.supported` is _true_ for FlexGroup volume)

### Important notes
* The "destination_only", "source_only", and "source_info_only" flags are mutually exclusive. If no flag is specified, the relationship is deleted from both the source and destination and all common snapshots between the source and destination are also deleted.
* For a restore relationship, the call must be executed on the cluster containing the destination endpoint without specifying the destination_only, source_only, or source_info_only parameters.
* Additionally, ensure that there are no ongoing transfers on a restore relationship before calling this API.
* The "failover", "force-failover" and "failback" query parameters are only applicable for SVM-DR SnapMirror relationships.
* When a SnapMirror relationship associated with a pair of source and destination Consistency Groups is deleted, the corresponding Consistency Groups on the source and destination clusters are not automatically deleted and remain in place.
* The "delete_lun_maps_in_destination" query parameter is applicable only for SnapMirror active sync relationships.
* The "unmap_namespace" query parameter is applicable only for NVMe SnapMirror active sync relationships.

This API is used to initiate SnapMirror operations such as "initialize", "resync", "break", "quiesce", and "resume" by specifying the appropriate value for the "state" field. It is also used to modify the SnapMirror policy associated with the specified relationship. Additionally, a SnapMirror relationship can be failed over to the destination endpoint or a failed over SnapMirror relationship can be failed back to the original state or a SnapMirror relationship direction can be reversed using this API. This API can also be used to expand the SnapMirror active sync relationship with the specified source and destination volumes.
<br>To initialize the relationship, PATCH the state to "snapmirrored" for relationships with a policy of type "async" or "in_sync" for relationships with a policy of type "sync".
<br>To break the relationship or to failover to the destination endpoint and start serving data from the destination endpoint, PATCH the state to "broken_off" for relationships with a policy of type "async" or "sync". SnapMirror relationships with the policy type as "sync" and sync_type as "automated_failover" cannot be "broken_off".

SnapMirror relationships with the policy type as "sync" and sync_type as "automated_failover" can be in "broken_off" state due to a failed attempt of automated SnapMirror failover operation.
<br>To pause the relationship, suspending further transfers, PATCH the state to "paused" for relationships with a policy of type "async" or "sync". SnapMirror relationships with the policy type as "sync" and sync_type as "automated_failover" cannot be "paused".
<br>To resume transfers for a paused relationship, PATCH the state to "snapmirrored" for relationships with a policy of type "async" or "in_sync" for relationships with a policy of type "sync".

For relationships with a policy of type "async" and relationship state as "snapmirrored", stop IO on the source endpoint and perform a SnapMirror transfer POST operation before reversing the direction of the relationship to prevent any loss of data.
<br>The values "in_sync", "out_of_sync", and "synchronizing" are only applicable to relationships with a policy of type "sync".
<br>When "transfer_schedule" is specified along with "state" during PATCH, first the schedule is modified on the relationship and then the respective SnapMirror operation is initiated. The "transfer_schedule" specified is used to update asynchronous relationships.
<br>When "throttle" is specified along with "state" during PATCH, first the throttle is modified on the relationship, which will be used by any upcoming transfers and then the respective SnapMirror operation is initiated. If the SnapMirror operation initiated a transfer then it will also use the new throttle. If "throttle" needs to be applied for a specific transfer use SnapMirror Transfer REST API.
<br>For SnapMirror active sync relationships, when "consistency_group_volumes" is specified during PATCH, first the existing FlexVol volume relationship is deleted and released and then the volumes are added to the SnapMirror active sync relationship.

### Important notes
* The property "transfer_schedule" if set on a SnapMirror relationship overrides the "transfer_schedule" set on the policy being used with the SnapMirror relationship.
* The property "throttle" if set on a SnapMirror relationship overrides the "throttle" set on the policy being used with the SnapMirror relationship.
* The properties "transfer_schedule" and "throttle" are not supported when "failback" is set to "true".

* The properties "transfer_schedule" and "throttle" are not supported when "force_failover" is set to "true".
* The properties "transfer_schedule" and "throttle" are not supported when the direction of the relationship is being reversed.
* To remove a transfer_schedule on a SnapMirror relationship set the "transfer_schedule" to null (no-quotes) during SnapMirror relationship PATCH.
* The property "identity_preservation" value can be changed from a higher "identity_preservation" threshold value to a lower "identity_preservation" threshold value but not vice-versa. For example, the threshold value of the "identity_preservation" property can be changed from "full" to "exclude_network_config", but cannot be increased from "exclude_network_and_protocol_config" to "exclude_network_config" to "full". The threshold value of the "identity_preservation" cannot be changed to "exclude_network_and_protocol_config" for IDP SVMDR.

* The property "backoff_level" is only applicable for FlexVol SnapMirror relationships.
### Examples
The following examples show how to perform the SnapMirror "resync", "initialize", "resume", "quiesce", and "break" operations. In addition, a relationship can be failed over to the destination endpoint and start serving data from the destination endpoint. A failed over relationship can be failed back to the source endpoint and serve data from the source endpoint. Also a relationship can be reversed by making the source endpoint as the new destination endpoint and the destination endpoint as the new source endpoint.

### Important notes
* The "destination_only", "source_only", and "source_info_only" flags are mutually exclusive. If no flag is specified, the relationship is deleted from both the source and destination and all common snapshots between the source and destination are also deleted.
* For a restore relationship, the call must be executed on the cluster containing the destination endpoint without specifying the destination_only, source_only, or source_info_only parameters.
* Additionally, ensure that there are no ongoing transfers on a restore relationship before calling this API.
* The "failover", "force-failover" and "failback" query parameters are only applicable for SVM-DR SnapMirror relationships.
* When a SnapMirror relationship associated with a pair of source and destination Consistency Groups is deleted, the corresponding Consistency Groups on the source and destination clusters are not automatically deleted and remain in place.
* The "delete_lun_maps_in_destination" query parameter is applicable only for SnapMirror active sync relationships.
* The "unmap_namespace" query parameter is applicable only for NVMe SnapMirror active sync relationships.

### Examples
The following examples show how to delete the relationship from both the source and destination, the destination only, and the source only.
<br/>
   Deleting the relationship from both the source and destination. This API must be run on the cluster containing the destination endpoint.
   <br/>
   ```
   DELETE "/api/snapmirror/relationships/4512b2d2-fd60-11e8-8929-005056bbfe52"
   ```
   <br/>
   Deleting the relationship on the destination only. This API must be run on the cluster containing the destination endpoint.
   <br/>
   ```
