Igroups within a peering relationship are replicated in the same stream, so the error reported here might be related to this igroup or a prior replicated igroup that is now blocking the replication of this igroup. Both the error information and the igroup encountering the error are reported. If the error is configuration related, it can be corrected on the referenced igroup. The replication is retried using exponential backoff up to a maximum of one retry every 5 minutes. Every operation on the same stream triggers an immediate retry and restarts the exponential backoff starting with a 1 second delay. If the error is system related, the retries should correct the error when the system enters a healthy state. """

If this igroup is in the replication queue and the queue is blocked by an error, the state is reported as _error_.
