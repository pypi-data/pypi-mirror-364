If it is not set, the default value is 6 hours. This value cannot be updated while a capacity rebalancing operation is running.  The maximum runtime can be in years, months, days, hours, and minutes. A period specified for years, months, and days is represented in the ISO-8601 format as "P<num>Y", "P<num>M", "P<num>D" respectively, for example "P3D" represents a duration of 3 days.

Only future capacity rebalancing operations will use the new "min_file_size" value. The value must be a multiple of 4KB. If it is not set, the default value is 100MB. Setting "min-file-size" to less than the default value leads to more files being moved. Moved files use granular data, which may impact read/write I/O performance. """
