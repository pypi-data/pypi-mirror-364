## Managing SnapMirror policies
This API is used to manage SnapMirror policies of type "async" and "sync". When applied to a SnapMirror relationship, the SnapMirror policy controls the behavior of the relationship and specifies the configuration attributes for that relationship.<br>The policy type "async" can be associated with a SnapMirror relationship that has either a FlexVol volume, FlexGroup volume, or SVM as the endpoint.<br>The policy type "sync" can be associated with a SnapMirror relationship that has a FlexVol volume or a consistency group as the endpoint. The policy type "sync" can have a "sync_type" of either "sync", "strict_sync", "automated_failover" or "automated_failover_duplex". If the "sync_type" is "sync", a write success is returned to the client after writing the data to the primary endpoint and before writing the data to the secondary endpoint. If the "sync_type" is "strict_sync", a write success is returned to the client after writing the data to both primary and secondary endpoints.<br>A "sync_type" of "automated_failover" can be associated with a SnapMirror relationship that has a consistency group as the endpoint and provides asymmetric active active access to the two storage copies.</br>A "sync_type" of "automated_failover_duplex" can be associated with a SnapMirror relationship that has a consistency group as the endpoint and provides symmetric active active access to the two storage copies.<br>

### Important notes
* The properties "retention.label" and "retention.count" are mandatory if "retention" is provided in the input. The provided "retention.label" is the final list and it replaces the existing values.
* The value of the "identity_preservation" property cannot be changed if the SnapMirror relationships associated with the policy have different identity_preservation configurations.
* If the SnapMirror policy "identity_preservation" value matches the "identity_preservation" value of the associated SnapMirror relationships, then the "identity_preservation" value can be changed from a higher "identity_preservation" threshold value to a lower "identity_preservation" threshold value but not vice-versa. For example, the threshold value of the "identity_preservation" property can be changed from "full" to "exclude_network_config", but cannot be increased from "exclude_network_and_protocol_config" to "exclude_network_config" to "full". The threshold value of the "identity_preservation" cannot be changed to "exclude_network_and_protocol_config" for IDP SVMDR.<br/>
* The policy properties "copy_all_source_snapshots", "copy_latest_source_snapshot", and "create_snapshot_on_source" cannot be modified.
* No "retention" properties can be modified if the "copy_all_source_snapshots" or "copy_latest_source_snapshot" property is present in the policy.
* Replacing or deleting all retention rules of a policy that has the "create_snapshot_on_source" property set to false in a single API call is not supported.
* Modifying the property "retention.label" for all retention rules of a policy that has the "create_snapshot_on_source" property set to false in a single API call is not supported.
* To remove a transfer_schedule on a SnapMirror policy set the "transfer_schedule" to null (no-quotes) during SnapMirror policy PATCH.

- The property "identity_preservation" is applicable to only SnapMirror relationships with SVM endpoints and it indicates which configuration of the source SVM is replicated to the destination SVM.
- The properties "identity_preservation" and "transfer_schedule" are not applicable for "sync" type policies.
- The properties "copy_all_source_snapshots", "copy_latest_source_snapshot", and "create_snapshot_on_source" are mutually exclusive.
- The properties "copy_all_source_snapshots", "copy_latest_source_snapshot", and "create_snapshot_on_source" are not applicable for "sync" type policies.
- No "retention" properties can be specified if "copy_all_source_snapshots" or 'copy_latest_source_snapshot' is specified.
- The properties "retention.creation_schedule" and "retention.prefix" are not applicable for "sync" type policies.
- The property "retention.creation_schedule" is not applicable for "async" policies with "create_snapshot_on_source" set to "false".
- The property "sync_common_snapshot_schedule" is not applicable for an "async" type policy.
- The property "retention.count" specifies the maximum number of snapshots that are retained on the SnapMirror destination volume.
- When the property "retention.label" is specified, the snapshots that have a SnapMirror label matching this property is transferred to the SnapMirror destination.
- When the property "retention.creation_schedule" is specified, snapshots are directly created on the SnapMirror destination. The snapshots created have the same content as the latest snapshot already present on the SnapMirror destination.
- The property "transfer_schedule" cannot be set to null (no-quotes) during SnapMirror policy POST.
- The properties "retention.label" and "retention.count" must be specified for "async" policies with "create_snapshot_on_source" set to "false".
- The property "retention.warn" is not supported for a policy when the "retention.preserve" property is false.
- The property "retention.warn" value must be less than the property "retention.count" value for a rule in a policy.

- `exclude_network_config` - indicates that the source SVM configuration other than network configuration is replicated to the destination SVM endpoint.
- `exclude_network_and_protocol_config` - indicates that the source SVM configuration is not replicated to the destination SVM endpoint.<br/>
### Important notes
- The property "identity_preservation" is applicable to only SnapMirror relationships with SVM endpoints and it indicates which configuration of the source SVM is replicated to the destination SVM.
- The properties "identity_preservation" and "transfer_schedule" are not applicable for "sync" type policies.
- The properties "copy_all_source_snapshots", "copy_latest_source_snapshot", and "create_snapshot_on_source" are mutually exclusive.
- The properties "copy_all_source_snapshots", "copy_latest_source_snapshot", and "create_snapshot_on_source" are not applicable for "sync" type policies.
- No "retention" properties can be specified if "copy_all_source_snapshots" or 'copy_latest_source_snapshot' is specified.
- The properties "retention.creation_schedule" and "retention.prefix" are not applicable for "sync" type policies.
- The property "retention.creation_schedule" is not applicable for "async" policies with "create_snapshot_on_source" set to "false".
- The property "sync_common_snapshot_schedule" is not applicable for an "async" type policy.
- The property "retention.count" specifies the maximum number of snapshots that are retained on the SnapMirror destination volume.
- When the property "retention.label" is specified, the snapshots that have a SnapMirror label matching this property is transferred to the SnapMirror destination.
- When the property "retention.creation_schedule" is specified, snapshots are directly created on the SnapMirror destination. The snapshots created have the same content as the latest snapshot already present on the SnapMirror destination.
- The property "transfer_schedule" cannot be set to null (no-quotes) during SnapMirror policy POST.
- The properties "retention.label" and "retention.count" must be specified for "async" policies with "create_snapshot_on_source" set to "false".
- The property "retention.warn" is not supported for a policy when the "retention.preserve" property is false.
- The property "retention.warn" value must be less than the property "retention.count" value for a rule in a policy.
  
### Required properties
* `name` - Name of the new SnapMirror policy.
### Recommended optional properties
* `svm.name` or `svm.uuid` - Name or UUID of the SVM that owns the SnapMirror policy.
### Default property values
If not specified in POST, the following default property values are assigned:
* `type` - _async_
* `sync_type` - _sync_ (when `type` is _sync_)
* `network_compression_enabled` - _false_
* `throttle` - _0_
* `identity_preservation` - `_exclude_network_and_protocol_config_`

### Important notes
* The properties "retention.label" and "retention.count" are mandatory if "retention" is provided in the input. The provided "retention.label" is the final list and it replaces the existing values.
* The value of the "identity_preservation" property cannot be changed if the SnapMirror relationships associated with the policy have different identity_preservation configurations.

For example, the threshold value of the "identity_preservation" property can be changed from "full" to "exclude_network_config", but cannot be increased from "exclude_network_and_protocol_config" to "exclude_network_config" to "full". The threshold value of the "identity_preservation" cannot be changed to "exclude_network_and_protocol_config" for IDP SVMDR.<br/>
* The policy properties "copy_all_source_snapshots", "copy_latest_source_snapshot", and "create_snapshot_on_source" cannot be modified.
* No "retention" properties can be modified if the "copy_all_source_snapshots" or "copy_latest_source_snapshot" property is present in the policy.
* Replacing or deleting all retention rules of a policy that has the "create_snapshot_on_source" property set to false in a single API call is not supported.
* Modifying the property "retention.label" for all retention rules of a policy that has the "create_snapshot_on_source" property set to false in a single API call is not supported.
* To remove a transfer_schedule on a SnapMirror policy set the "transfer_schedule" to null (no-quotes) during SnapMirror policy PATCH.
