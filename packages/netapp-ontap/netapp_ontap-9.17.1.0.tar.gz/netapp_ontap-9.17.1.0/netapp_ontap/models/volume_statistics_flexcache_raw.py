For example, if the aggregation of data over multiple nodes fails, then any partial errors might return "ok" on success or "error" on an internal uncategorized failure. Whenever a sample collection is missed but done at a later time, it is back filled to the previous 15 second timestamp and tagged with "backfilled_data". "Inconsistent_ delta_time" is encountered when the time between two collections is not the same for all nodes. Therefore, the aggregated value might be over or under inflated. "Negative_delta" is returned when an expected monotonically increasing value has decreased in value. "Inconsistent_old_data" is returned when one or more nodes do not have the latest data.

Valid choices:

* ok
* error
* partial_no_data
* partial_no_uuid
* partial_no_response
* partial_other_error
* negative_delta
* backfilled_data
* inconsistent_delta_time
