.. admonition:: What is pyGMM?
   :class: important

   pyGMM is a Python library for evaluating ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs).
   It provides a unified interface to numerous published ground motion models, making it
   easy to compare predictions and perform probabilistic seismic hazard analysis.

        **ðŸ”§ Easy Integration**

        Simple installation and integration with existing Python workflows.

Getting Started
===============

Install pyGMM using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pygmm

Quick example:

.. code-block:: python

   import pygmm

   # Create a scenario
   scenario = pygmm.Scenario(mag=6.5, dist_rup=20, v_s30=760)

   # Initialize a ground motion model
   gmpe = pygmm.CampbellBozorgnia2014()

   # Calculate ground motion
   mean, std = gmpe(scenario)
