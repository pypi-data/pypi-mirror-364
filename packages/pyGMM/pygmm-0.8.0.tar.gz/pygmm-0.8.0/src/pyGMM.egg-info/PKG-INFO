Ground motion models implemented in Python.

I have recently learned that additional ground motion models have been
implemented through GEM\'s OpenQuake
[Hazardlib](https://github.com/gem/oq-hazardlib), which I recommend
checking out.

## Features

Models currently supported:

-   Akkar, Sandikkaya, & Bommer (2014) with unit tests
-   Atkinson & Boore (2006)
-   Abrahamson, Silva, & Kamai (2014) with unit tests
-   Abrahamson, Gregor, & Addo (2016) with unit tests
-   Boore, Stewart, Seyhan, & Atkinson (2014) with unit tests
-   Campbell (2003)
-   Campbell & Bozorgnia (2014) with unit tests
-   Chiou & Youngs (2014) with unit tests
-   Derras, Bard & Cotton (2013) with unit tests
-   Idriss (2014) with unit tests
-   Pezeshk, Zandieh, & Tavakoli (2001)
-   Tavakoli & Pezeshk (2005)

Conditional spectra models:

-   Baker & Jayaram (2008) with unit tests
-   Kishida (2017) with unit tests

Duration models:

-   Kempton and Stewart (2006)
-   Afshari and Stewart (2016)

Most models are tested with unit tests that test the implemention of the
model.
