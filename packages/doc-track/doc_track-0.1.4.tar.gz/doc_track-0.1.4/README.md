# doc-track

doc-track is a tool that allows developpers to make CI fail when a piece of code marked as "is documented" is added / modified / deleted.

# Installation
```bash
pip install doc-track
```

# Usage
```bash
doc-track check
```

# options available
`--version-from` # Git version of comparison used

`--version-to` # Git version to compare the first version to

`--path` # Path where comparison is checked

`--tags` # Pair list of start / end tag: `... --tags "# start","# end" "#start","#end"...`

`--config` # to specify config file, default .doctrack.yml

`--fail-status` # Return code in case code documented is modified, default 0

`--show-result` # To enable showing result in error output, default True

`--skip-blank-lines` # To skip blank lines changes of documented code, default True

# Config
You can add a configuration file that must respect the .yml format.

All options listed above are also available in the config file.

Here is an example of a typical usage for a python project's CI/CD:

```yaml
# .doctrack.yml

version_from: master
version_to: HEAD
path: .

tags:
  - ["# doc", "# enddoc"]

fail_status: 1
show_result: True
skip_blank_lines: True
```

# Mark code as documented

To mark code as documented, wrap it with both start tag and end tag.

Tag must be the only text on the line:
```python
class A:
    # doc
    def fct():
        return 22
    # enddoc
```
End tag must be different from start tag
