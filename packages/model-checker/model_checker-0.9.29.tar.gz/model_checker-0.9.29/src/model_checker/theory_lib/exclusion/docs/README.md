# Exclusion Theory Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the exclusion theory implementation. This guide provides streamlined navigation to our core documentation.

## Quick Start

- **New to unilateral semantics?** → Start with [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md)
- **Need API reference?** → See [TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md](TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md)
- **Understanding the architecture?** → Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Implementing a semantic theory?** → Study [LESSONS_LEARNED.md](LESSONS_LEARNED.md)

## Core Documentation

### **[USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md)**
Accessible introduction to unilateral semantics with practical examples. Covers theoretical background, getting started, and common usage patterns.

### **[TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md](TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md)**
Complete API documentation including all classes, methods, operators, and code examples. Essential reference for developers.

### **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)**
System design documentation covering the witness predicate pattern, two-phase architecture, and module organization. Includes key innovations and design patterns.

### **[IMPLEMENTATION_STORY.md](IMPLEMENTATION_STORY.md)**
The complete narrative of solving the False Premise Problem through nine implementation attempts. Shows how the witness predicate solution emerged.

### **[LESSONS_LEARNED.md](LESSONS_LEARNED.md)**
Practical wisdom for implementing complex semantic theories, including Z3 patterns, architectural insights, and anti-patterns to avoid.

## Additional Resources

### **[DATA.md](DATA.md)**
Analysis of formulas, operators, and test coverage across the implementation.

### **[ITERATE.md](ITERATE.md)**
Iterator support documentation for exclusion theory.
