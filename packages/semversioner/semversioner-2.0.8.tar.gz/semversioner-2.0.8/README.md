# Semversioner

The easiest way to manage [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) in your project and generate CHANGELOG.md file automatically.

Semversioner will provide the tooling to automate semver release process for libraries, docker images, etc.

This project was inspired by the way AWS manages their versioning for [AWS-cli](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/).

## Semantic Versioning

The [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) spec involves several possible variations, but to simplify, in _Semversioner_ we are using the three-part version number:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

Constructed with the following guidelines:

- Breaking backward compatibility or major features bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch).
- New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch).
- Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch.

An example would be 1.0.0

## How it works

At any given time, the ``.semversioner/`` directory looks like:

    .semversioner
    └── next-release
        ├── minor-20181227010225.json
        └── major-20181228010225.json
    ├── 1.1.0.json
    ├── 1.1.1.json
    ├── 1.1.2.json

The release process takes everything in ``next-release`` and aggregates them all together in a single JSON file for that release (e.g ``1.12.0.json``).  This
JSON file is a list of all the individual JSON files from ``next-release``.

## Install

```shell
pip install semversioner
```

## Usage

### Bumping the version

In your local environment your will use the CLI to create the different changeset files that will be committed with your code. For example:

```shell
semversioner add-change --type patch --description "Fix security vulnerability with authentication."
```

Then, in your CI/CD tool you will need to release (generating automatically version number) and creating the the changelog file.

```shell
semversioner release
```

### Generating Changelog

As a part of your CI/CD workflow, you will be able to generate the changelog file with all changes.

```shell
semversioner changelog > CHANGELOG.md
```

You can customize the changelog by creating a template and passing it as parameter to the command. For example:

```shell
semversioner changelog --template .semversioner/config/template.j2
```

The template is using [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/), a templating language for Python. For example:

```
# Changelog
{% for release in releases %}

## {{ release.version }}

{% for change in release.changes %}
- {{ change.type }}: {{ change.description }}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```

Since semversioner `2.0` you can also add custom attributes to the changeset file that will be available in the release template:

```shell
semversioner add-change --type patch --description "My custom changelog message with attributes." --attributes pr_id=322 --attributes issue_id=123
```

Then, you can show the attributes in the changelog template. For example:

```
# Changelog
Note: version releases in the 0.x.y range may introduce breaking changes.
{% for release in releases %}

## {{ release.version }} (<DATE>)

{% for change in release.changes %}
- {{ change.type }}: {{ change.description }}{{ ' (#' + change.attributes.pr_id + ')' if change.attributes }}{{ ' (J' + change.attributes.issue_id + ')' if change.attributes }}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```

You can filter the changelog by only showing changes for a specific version:

```shell
semversioner changelog --version "1.0.0"
```

Alternatively, you can use the following command to filter changes by the last released version:

```shell
semversioner changelog --version $(semversioner current-version)
```

### Getting next version

As part of the CI/CD workflow, sometimes you want to release dev, rc, or other pre-release packages. For this purpose,
the next-version command can be issued, to compute the next version based on the current change set. This will
not change any files on disk, and they are as such preserved for any future release.

```shell
semversioner next-version
```
