# footprint ðŸ‘£

I use this to generate config files for my flask apps. Currently systemd and nginx.
It only depends on Flask.

It is intended to be installed into the same virtual environment that the flask
app inhabits so it can introspect the app. It has no dependencies other than Flask.

```bash
export FLASK_APP=your_package.wsgi
footprint config nginx www.example.com > example.conf
footprint config nginx-install example.conf
```

```bash
# install in ~/.config/systemd/user
export FLASK_APP=your_package.wsgi
footprint config systemd --user  > example.service
footprint config systemd-install --user example.service
```

will install nginx and systemd files that will statically serve you 'static' assets and
run the Flask app with gunicorn.

Mostly I've found that confectioning these files by hand are highly error prone. These
commands will at least get the absolute pathnames correct :)

`footprint` will install a Quart (ASGI) service using the `--asgi` to flag. In this case you need
both the `quart` and `uvicorn-worker` packages installed *also*.

Install with:

```bash
python -m pip install flask-nginx
python -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/arabidopsis/footprint.git
# or
# git clone https://github.com/arabidopsis/footprint.git
# cd footprint
# python -m pip install [--editable] .
```

or add to your `pyproject.toml` file

```toml
footprint = { git = "https://github.com/arabidopsis/footprint.git", branch="main" }
```

Once installed you can upgrade with:

```bash
footprint update
# or
uv pip install -U $(footprint repo)
```

If `footprint` finds a `pyproject.toml` file in the current directory
if will try to load `[tool.footprint]` values into its global configuration object.


## `nginx`, `systemd` and all that

Note that these configuration generating functions are
not infallible. Please examine the generated configure files
_carefully_! They are mainly useful for getting the directory
names correct etc. So if you move your repo then you will
have to regenerate and reinstall the files.

- [Nginx Docs](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/). [Also](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) and [Proxy](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html)

Test an nginx config with e.g.:

```bash
website=~/Sites/websites/ppr
export FLASK_APP=ppr.wsgi
footprint config nginx --app-dir=$website example.org | footprint config nginx-run --app-dir=$website -
```

This will run nginx at the terminal listening on port 2048 and run the backend
website.

To install a website:

```bash
footprint config nginx --app-dir=$website example.org -o website.conf
footprint config systemd [--user] --app-dir=$website -o website.service
# nginx requires sudo (default) or su
footprint config nginx-install website.conf
# if you can install into ~/.config/systemd/user
footprint config systemd-install [--user] website.service
```

You can test _this_ locally by editing `/etc/hosts` and adding a line:

`127.0.0.1 example.org`

to the file.

**REMEMBER**: Unix file permissions mean that you should edit `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
and change `user www-data;` to `user {you};` Or (recursively) change the owner on
all the repo directories to `www-data`.

If you install as "user" (i.e. `footprint config systemd --user ...`) then
**to ensure that the user systemd starts at boot time use**: `sudo loginctl enable-linger <user>`

See [here](https://nts.strzibny.name/systemd-user-services/):

> But whatâ€™s the real reason for having user services?
> To answer that, we have to realize when the enabled service starts and stops.
> If we enable a user service, it starts on user login, and runs as long as there is a
> session open for that user. Once the last session dies, the service stops.

See [digitalocean.com here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04) for a tutorial about serving flask from nginx.

Uninstall with `footprint config nginx-uninstall website.conf` and `footprint config systemd-uninstall [--user] website.service`

### `.flaskenv`

If a `.flaskenv` is found in the repo directory then nginx and systemd will
read paramters from that file. The keywords should be _uppercase_ version of
the known parameters. Unknown parameters will be ignored.
