Cycler management, data pipeline, and data visualisation for Empa's robotic battery lab.

- Tracks samples, experiments and results.
- Control Neware and Biologic cyclers on multiple machines from one place.
- Automatically collect and analyse cycling data.
- Results in consistent, open format including metadata with provenance tracking and sample information.
- Convenient cycler control and in-depth data exploration using `Dash`-based webapp.

### Jobs

Aurora cycler manager can be used to control and submit experiments to Biologic and Neware cyclers. Biologic cyclers are controlled through `tomato`, and Neware through a Python API.

Jobs can be either be submitted with a cycler-specific file (e.g. xml protocols for Neware).

Alternatively, a `unicycler` universal .json protocol can be used, which is converted to the appropriate format on submission. `unicycler` protocols can currently be converted to Neware .xml, `tomato` .json, and `PyBaMM` experiments. It is particularly useful for generating Neware .xml which can be difficult to define programmatically.

Experiments can use C-rates and the program will automatically calculate the current required based on the sample information in the database.

### Data harvesting

Data is automatically gathered from cyclers. Harvesters are also available to download data from Biologic's EC-Lab.

The program converts all incoming filetypes to one open standard - accepts Biologic .mpr, `tomato` .json, Neware .ndax, and Neware .xlsx. Raw time-series data is converted to a hdf5 file including provenance tracked metadata.

### Analysis

The time-series hdf5 data is analysed to extract per-cycle summary data such as charge and discharge capacities, stored alongside metadata in a .json file.

### Visualisation

A web-app based on `Plotly Dash` allows rapid, interactive viewing of time-series and per-cycle data, as well as the ability to control experiments on tomato cyclers through the graphical interface.

## Installation

In a Python environment:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/EmpaEconversion/aurora-cycler-manager.git
```
After successfully installing, run and follow the instructions:
```
aurora-setup
```
To _view data from an existing set up_:
- Say yes to 'Connect to an existing configuration and database', then give the path to this folder.

To _interact with servers on an existing set up_:
- Interacting with servers (submitting jobs, harvesting data etc.) works with OpenSSH
- Generate a public/private key pair on your system with `ssh-keygen`
- Ensure your public key is authorized on the system running the cycler
- In config.json fill in 'SSH private key path' and 'Snapshots folder path'
- Snapshots folder path stores the raw data downloaded from cyclers which is processed. This data can be deleted any time.
- To connect and control `tomato` servers, `tomato v0.2.3` must be configured on the remote PC
- To harvest from EC-Lab or Neware cyclers, set data to save/backup to some location and specify this location in the shared configuration file

To _create a new set up_: 
- Use `aurora-setup` to create a configuration and database - it is currently designed with network storage in mind, so other users can access data.
- Fill in the configuration file with details about e.g. tomato, Neware and EC-Lab servers. Examples are left in the default config file.

## Updating

From versions `0.5.x` you do not have to re-do any of the setup steps, just upgrade with pip:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/EmpaEconversion/aurora-cycler-manager.git --upgrade
```
If upgrading from earlier versions, first `pip uninstall aurora-cycler-manager` then follow the installation steps.

## Usage

A web app allows users to view analysed data and see the status of samples, jobs, and cyclers, and submit jobs to cyclers if they have access. Run with:
```
aurora-app
```

To upload sample information to the database, place output .json files from the Aurora robot into the samples folder defined in the configuration.

Hand-made cells can also be added, a .json must be created with the keys defined in the shared configuration.

Loading samples, submitting jobs etc. can be performed on `tomato` or Neware directly, or using the `aurora-app` GUI, or by writing a Python script to use the functions in server_manager.py.

With SSH access, automatic data harvesting and analysis is run using:
```
aurora-daemon
```
