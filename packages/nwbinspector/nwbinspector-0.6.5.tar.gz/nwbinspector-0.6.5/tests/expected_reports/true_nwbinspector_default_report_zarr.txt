0  CRITICAL
===========

0.0  ./testing0.nwb.zarr: check_data_orientation - 'SpatialSeries' object at location '/processing/behavior/Position/my_spatial_series'
       Message: Data may be in the wrong orientation. Time should be in the first dimension, and is usually the longest dimension. Here, another dimension is longer.

0.1  ./testing0.nwb.zarr: check_timestamps_match_first_dimension - 'TimeSeries' object at location '/acquisition/test_time_series_3'
       Message: The length of the first dimension of data (4) does not match the length of timestamps (3).

1  BEST_PRACTICE_VIOLATION
==========================

1.2  ./testing0.nwb.zarr and 1 other file: check_regular_timestamps - 'TimeSeries' object at location '/acquisition/test_time_series_2'
       Message: TimeSeries appears to have a constant sampling rate. Consider specifying starting_time=1.2 and rate=0.5 instead of timestamps.

2  BEST_PRACTICE_SUGGESTION
===========================

2.3  ./testing0.nwb.zarr: check_small_dataset_compression - 'TimeSeries' object at location '/acquisition/test_time_series_1'
       Message: data is not compressed. Consider enabling compression when writing a dataset.
