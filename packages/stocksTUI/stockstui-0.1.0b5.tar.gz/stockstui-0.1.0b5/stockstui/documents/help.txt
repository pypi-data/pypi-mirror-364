NAME
    stockstui - A terminal user interface for monitoring stock data.

SYNOPSIS
    stockstui [OPTIONS]
    stockstui [VIEW_OPTION] [TICKER(S)]
    stockstui -o, --output [LISTS] [--session-list ...]

DESCRIPTION
    stocksTUI is a modern, terminal-based application for watching stock prices,
    viewing historical data, and reading the latest financial news. It uses a
    configurable, tabbed interface to organize assets into watchlists and
    provides a suite of tools for analysis and debugging.

    The application can be run as a full Terminal User Interface (TUI) or in a
    direct output mode for scripting and quick lookups from the command line.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
        Show a concise help message listing all command-line options and exit.

    --man
        Display this full user manual and exit.

    -v, -V, --version
        Show the application's version number and exit.

    TUI VIEW OPTIONS (Mutually Exclusive)

    --tab LIST_NAME
        Start the application on a specific watchlist tab. LIST_NAME should
        correspond to a list defined in your lists.json config file (e.g.,
        "stocks", "crypto").

    -H, --history [TICKER]
        Start on the History tab. If TICKER is provided, historical data for
        that symbol will be loaded. If omitted, the view will be empty.

    -N, --news [TICKER,TICKER2,...]
        Start on the News tab. If one or more comma-separated TICKER(S) are
        provided, a combined news feed for those symbols will be loaded.
        If omitted, the view will be empty.

    --debug
        Start on the Debug tab, which provides tools for testing API latency
        and cache performance.

    --configs
        Start on the Configs tab, where you can manage watchlists, themes,
        and other application settings.

    OUTPUT & SESSION OPTIONS

    -o, --output [LISTS]
        Output data directly to the terminal without launching the TUI.
        If no LISTS are provided, all tickers from all configured lists
        are displayed. LISTS can be a single watchlist name or a comma-
        separated list of names (e.g., stocks,crypto).

    --session-list NAME=TICKER1,TICKER2 ...
        Create one or more temporary watchlists for the current session only.
        Works in both TUI and --output modes. This option can be specified
        multiple times.
        Example: stockstui -o --session-list mylist=AAPL,MSFT

    --period {1d,5d,1mo,6mo,ytd,1y,5y,max}
        When used with --history, specifies the initial time period for the
        data chart or table.

    -c, --chart
        When used with --history, shows the chart view by default instead of
        the data table.

CONFIGURATION
    Configuration files are located in the standard user config directory
    (e.g., `~/.config/stockstui/` on Linux).

    - `lists.json`: Defines your watchlists.
    - `portfolios.json`: Defines your portfolios and associated tickers.
    - `settings.json`: Controls application behavior like theme and auto-refresh.
    - `themes.json`: Contains color palettes for different themes.

    Cache and log files are located in the standard user cache directory
    (e.g., `~/.cache/stockstui/` on Linux).

    - `app_cache.db`: A SQLite database used to cache price and ticker metadata.
    - `stockstui.log`: A debug log file.
    
    These files can be safely deleted to reset caches or configuration.

NOTES
    All ticker symbols must be in the format used by Yahoo Finance
    (e.g., 'AAPL', '^GSPC' for S&P 500, 'BTC-USD' for Bitcoin).
