## ‚ú® Features

*   **Live-ish Price Data**
    Watch your favorite tickers update in near real-time with configurable refresh intervals.

*   **Watchlists That Make Sense**
    Organize your assets into lists like "Tech", "Crypto", "Dividend Traps", or "Memes". Manage them entirely from the UI ‚Äî no need to touch JSON unless you want to.

*   **Tag-Based Filtering**
    Assign tags (e.g., `growth`, `ev`, `semiconductor`) to your tickers and instantly filter any watchlist to see only what's relevant.

*   **Charts & Tables, Your Way**
    View historical performance from `1D` to `Max`, from a table or a chart.

*   **News That Matters**
    See the latest headlines per ticker or a combined feed ‚Äî no ads, no autoplay videos, just info.

*   **Keyboard-Friendly, Mouse-Optional**
    Navigate everything with Vim-style keys or arrow keys. Bonus: lots of helpful keybindings, fully documented.

*   **Custom Themes & Settings**
    Tweak the look and feel with built-in themes or your own. Set your default tab, hide unused ones, and make it feel like *your* dashboard.

*   **Smart Caching**
    The app remembers what it can. Market-aware caching keeps startup fast and avoids pointless API calls on weekends or holidays.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: All symbols follow [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) format ‚Äî e.g., `AAPL` for Apple, `^GSPC` for S\&P 500, and `BTC-USD` for Bitcoin.
