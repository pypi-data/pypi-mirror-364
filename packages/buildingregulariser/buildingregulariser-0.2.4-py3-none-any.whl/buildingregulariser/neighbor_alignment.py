    Aligns a single polygon's orientation with its neighbours if a dominant direction is detected.

    For a given polygon index in the GeoDataFrame, this function identifies neighbouring polygons
    within a specified buffer, aggregates their directional data weighted by perimeter, and, if
    conditions are met, rotates the polygon to align with the dominant neighbour direction.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    idx : int
        Index of the polygon row in the GeoDataFrame.
    buffer_size : float
        Distance used to define the neighbourhood search area around the polygon.
    max_rotation : float
        Maximum allowed rotation (in degrees) from the current to the proposed direction.

    Aligns the orientation of polygons in a GeoDataFrame based on their neighbors' dominant direction.

    Each polygon is evaluated in parallel. A buffer is used to identify neighboring polygons,

    a defined angular threshold, the polygon is rotated to match it.
