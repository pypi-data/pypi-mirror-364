## üöÄ What is Arkhon Memory?

Most agent ‚Äúmemory‚Äù is brittle: chat logs, hacky context, or heavyweight vector DBs.

Who is this for: Indie hackers, researchers, agent devs, and tinkerers, ANYONE tired of vector DBs or lock-in memory ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù.

Builders who want cognitive-like, composable memory ‚Äî not chat history hacks - AND all of it is happening/stored locally not in anyone elses cloud.

**Arkhon** is a *lightweight, composable memory layer*:
- JSON-native, structured, and easy to reason about
- Tracks relevance over time (with time decay + reuse boosting)
- Designed for event-driven, session-aware agent workflows
- No dependencies except Python & [pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/)

> Arkhon is the ‚Äúactive memory‚Äù foundation of a much larger system we call Cathedral.  
> This SDK is for builders who want real persistence ‚Äî and want to keep their stack simple.

- **Tagging & snapshots**: organize, search, and summarize memory easily
- **Session lifecycle hooks**: manage memory at start/end of sessions
- **No bloat**: no vector DBs, no LangChain, no black-box magic

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start (included in examples folder)

```python
from arkhon_memory.memory_hub import MemoryHub
from arkhon_memory.schemas import MemoryItem
from arkhon_memory.lifecycle import on_session_start, on_session_exit
from datetime import datetime

hub = on_session_start("demo_memory.json")
item = MemoryItem(
    content="Tokyo has the world's largest metro population.",
    tags=["geography", "asia"],
    timestamp=datetime.utcnow(),
)
hub.append(item)

results = hub.query("tokyo")
for r in results:
    print("Found:", r.content, r.tags)

on_session_exit(
    hub,
    tags=["demo", "test"],
    summary="Demo session saving basic fact about Tokyo.",
    title="Tokyo Fact Demo"
)
