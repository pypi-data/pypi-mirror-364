This is not actually included in the downloadable data -- for example, Mylotarg was withdrawn from the market but may still be worth investigating for other indications.\n",
    " * **\"Was FDA approved yr\"**: Appears to just be a claim about (first?) FDA approval date. No indication of later withdrawal."
