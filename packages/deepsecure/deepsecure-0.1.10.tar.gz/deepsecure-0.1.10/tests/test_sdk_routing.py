Test Phase 2 Task 2.5: SDK Gateway Routing

This test suite validates the SDK routing changes for Phase 2 to ensure:
1. Tool calls route through deeptrail-gateway
2. Management operations still go direct to deeptrail-control
3. SDK transparency (no developer code changes)
4. Backward compatibility

Architecture Requirements (from attached lines 1-11):
- Management Operations (Phase 1) -> Direct to deeptrail-control
  ├── Agent Management (create, list, delete)
  ├── Policy Management (create, update, delete)  
  ├── Authentication (challenge, token)
  └── Credential Operations (issue, revoke)

- Tool Operations (Phase 2) -> Through deeptrail-gateway
  ├── External API Calls (OpenAI, Google, AWS)
  ├── Secret Injection
  ├── Policy Enforcement
  └── Audit Logging
