# examples/07_multi_agent_communication.py
"""
This example demonstrates secure, delegated agent-to-agent (A2A) communication
using the DeepSecure SDK and Macaroons.

🎯 **PRODUCTION-READY DELEGATION EXAMPLE**

This example showcases the implemented macaroon-based delegation system where:
1. A "Manager Agent" delegates financial data access to a "Finance Agent" 
2. The delegation is cryptographically secured with time limits and restrictions
3. The Finance Agent can use the delegated token to access secrets temporarily
4. All delegation activities are audited and traceable

Scenario:
1. A "Manager Agent" needs to get a stock price, but delegates this task
2. A "Finance Agent" specializes in financial data retrieval
3. The Manager Agent uses `client.delegate_access()` to create a secure macaroon
4. The Finance Agent uses the delegated macaroon to access the required secret
5. The delegation automatically expires after the specified time

The Flow:
1. Manager Agent calls `client.delegate_access()` with specific restrictions
2. DeepSecure creates a cryptographically signed macaroon with embedded caveats
3. Manager Agent passes this macaroon to the Finance Agent
4. Finance Agent uses the macaroon to make authenticated requests
5. Gateway verifies the macaroon signature and enforces all caveats
6. If valid, the secret is returned; otherwise access is denied

Security Features:
- Cryptographic macaroon signatures prevent forgery
- Time-based expiration (TTL) limits exposure window  
- Resource restrictions ensure least-privilege access
- Action limitations control what operations are allowed
- Audit trail tracks all delegation activities

Prerequisites:
1. `pip install deepsecure`
2. A running DeepSecure backend (control plane and gateway)
3. Your DeepSecure CLI is configured (`deepsecure configure`)
4. A secret stored in the vault:
   `deepsecure vault secrets store tavily-api-key --value "your_tavily_key"`
