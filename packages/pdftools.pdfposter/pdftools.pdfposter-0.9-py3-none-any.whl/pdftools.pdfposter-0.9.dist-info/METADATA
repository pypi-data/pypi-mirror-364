``Pdfposter`` can be used to create a large poster by building it from
multiple pages and/or printing it on large media. It expects as input a
PDF file, normally printing on a single page. The output is again a
PDF file, maybe containing multiple pages together building the
poster.
The input page will be scaled to obtain the desired size.

This is much like ``poster`` does for Postscript files, but working
with PDF. Since sometimes poster does not like your files converted
from PDF. :-) Indeed ``pdfposter`` was inspired by ``poster``.

.. important::

   This is a transitional package.
   Starting with version 0.9,
   the package and the module have been renamed to just 'pdfposter'.
   Please use the new package pdfposter__.

   The package 'pdftools.pdfposter' will not receive any more updates.
   Older versions will still be available at PyPI__, of course.

Why has this package been renamed?
===================================

When converting this from a script into a library back in 2008, the idea was
to create a collection of tools all sharing the "pdftools" namespace and
eventually sharing some commend code (e.g. definition of paper sizes).
Anyhow, I never did this â€” even when creating more "pdftools.*" packages.
And meanwhile there is a Python package called "pdftools".
Thus I decided to rename this package to avoid conflicts with that very
package (and as a side-effect to simplify my tooling).


Migrating from `pdftools.pdfposter` to `pdfposter`
==================================================

Migrating from `pdftools.pdfposter` to `pdfposter` is easy:
Simply replace `pdftools.pdfposter` by just `pdfposter` in your code.

Here are some snippets that might help you::

  sed -i 's/pdftools\.pdfposter/pdfposter/g' *.py setup.cfg *.toml
  sed -i 's/from pdftools\.pdfposter import /from pdfposter import /g' *.py
  sed -i 's/from pdftools import pdfposter/import pdfposter/g' *.py
