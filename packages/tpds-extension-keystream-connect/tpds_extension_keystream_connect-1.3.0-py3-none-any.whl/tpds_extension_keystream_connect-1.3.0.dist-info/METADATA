### Updates
#### Device Onboarding
    - Device Onboarding is the process by which a device is registered in keySTREAM server with a certain device identity and attached to a certain device vendor. Device onboarding is performed automatically by keySTREAM as part of the in-field device identity provisioning process.
#### Device Certificate Renewal
    - A new certificate will be generated and provisioned to the device before the old one expires. Renewing a certificate does not mean changing the associated key pair. **The key pair stays the same.**
