Architecture
============

There are three main components in play:

1. The browser.

2. Plone server, providing two views: the user-facing ``@@collabora-edit`` view, and
   the Collabora callback API ``@@collabora-wopi``.

3. Collabora Online server.

Collabora needs to be accessible from the browser.
Plone needs to be not only accessible from the browser, but *also from Collabora*.

The following diagram illustrates the information flow.

Opening a file for read access
------------------------------

- Open the Plone view ``@@collabora-edit``. This is integrated in the Plone UI as an
  action called ``Open``.

- The ``collabora-edit`` view renders with an iframe.

- The iframe loads the Collabora Online UI. The URL for that iframe contains
  the callback URL ``collabora-wopi`` that Collabora will use to communicate with
  Plone in steps (4) and (7).

- Collabora retrieves the file to be edited directly from Plone, outside of the
  browser, by accessing the WOPI URL ``@@collabora-wopi``. It uses a JWT access
  token encoded in the iframe URL to connect to Plone as the user that has
  opened ``collabora-edit``.

The file is now rendered in the iframe in the browser. If the user has ``View``
permissions, but not ``Modify portal content``, the flow ends here. The user can
read the document and any comments other collaborators made on the document in
Collabora.

Editing a file and saving changes
---------------------------------

- If the user opening the document has ``Modify portal content`` permission on
  the file, a real-time editing session is opened.

- Any changes the user makes to the document, will be autosaved.

- The save is performed by Collabora issuing a POST request to the Plone view
  ``@@collabora-wopi``. That view checks permissions, and performs the save. In case
  of a write/locking conflict, that's communicated back to Collabora which will
  open a UI for the user to resolve this.

- Some actions, like ``Save and exit``, can be performed on the ``collabora-edit``
  view outside of the iframe. The Plone document communicates such actions to
  the Collabora iframe via the postMessage API, see:
  https://sdk.collaboraonline.com/docs/postmessage_api.html

Note that Collabora will issue a PUT request to save the file, once the last user
leaves a collaborative editing session on a document. Even if a user makes changes
and then directly kills their browser window, the document will be saved.
