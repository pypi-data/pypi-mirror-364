Installation
============

Install collective.collabora by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        collective.collabora


and then run ``bin/buildout``.

You can then install collective.collabora though the add-on control panel.

For this to work, you need to have a Collabora Online service up and running.
