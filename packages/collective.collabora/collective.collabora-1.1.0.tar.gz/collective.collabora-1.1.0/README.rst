collective.collabora
====================

Collabora Online integration for Plone.


Introduction
------------

`Collabora Online <https://www.collaboraonline.com/>`_ provides collaborative open source document editing, controlled by you.

Collective.collabora brings this capability into Plone. It can be used as-is,
and works out of the box in about any Plone version.

Additionally, collective.collabora provides a building block for integration of
real-time document collaboration into Plone-based applications like
Quaive and iA.Delib.

Features
--------

- Real-time collaborative document editing of office-type documents: Word
  documents, spreadsheets, etc.

- Reading Office files and PDFs in your browser in a Plone page, with comments,
  even if you do not have edit rights.

- Wide compatibility of this add-on across Plone and Python versions.

Documentation
-------------

For instructions on configuring collective.collabora,
see the documentation at `Read the Docs <https://collectivecollabora.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Authors
-------

- Johannes Raggam (thet): initial proof of concept (integration, WOPI implementation).

- Guido A.J. Stevens (gyst): production quality code (cleanup, tests, CI, documentation, backporting, release).
