"""
This script is part of the seasonal forecast module developed within the U-CLIMADAPT project.
It provides functionality for accessing, processing, and analyzing seasonal forecast data
from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS), with an emphasis on computing heat-related
climate indices and supporting impact-based forecasting.

The module is designed to interface with CLIMADA but can also be used independently.
The design is modular and flexible, allowing it to be easily adapted to support
new climate indices or to serve individual steps in the workflow — such as data download,
index calculation, or hazard generation — depending on the user's needs.
