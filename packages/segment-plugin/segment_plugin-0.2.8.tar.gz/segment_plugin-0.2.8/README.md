## Release Process

This project uses automated versioning and publishing. Here's how to create a new release:

### Prerequisites

1. Install `bump-my-version`:
   ```bash
   pip install bump-my-version
   ```

2. Make sure all your changes are committed and pushed to `main`

### Creating a Release

1. **Finalize your changes** - Make sure your final patch is committed and pushed:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Final changes for release"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Bump the version** - This automatically updates `Cargo.toml`, creates a commit, and tags the release:
   ```bash
   # For bug fixes
   bump-my-version bump patch    # 0.1.0 → 0.1.1
   
   # For new features
   bump-my-version bump minor    # 0.1.0 → 0.2.0
   
   # For breaking changes
   bump-my-version bump major    # 0.1.0 → 1.0.0
   ```

3. **Push the tag** - This triggers automatic publishing to PyPI:
   ```bash
   git push origin main --tags
   ```
   The package will be updated at https://pypi.org/project/segment-plugin
