def future_value_annuity(payment: float, rate: float, periods: int) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the future value of a series of equal payments with discrete compounding.

    Parameters
    ----------
    payment : float
        Amount invested each period (e.g., annually).
    rate : float
        Interest rate per period (as decimal).
    periods : int
        Number of periods (e.g., years).

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Future value of the investment.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> future_value_annuity(1000, 0.05, 10)
    12577.89  # example value
    """
    fv = payment * (((1 + rate) ** periods - 1) / rate)

def future_value_growing_annuity(
    payment: float, rate: float, growth: float, periods: int
) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the future value of a growing annuity (constant growth in payments).

    Parameters
    ----------
    payment : float
        Initial payment.
    rate : float
        Interest rate per period (as decimal).
    growth : float
        Growth rate of payment per period (as decimal).
    periods : int
        Number of periods.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Future value of the growing annuity.

    Notes
    -----
    If the interest rate equals the growth rate, a simplified formula is used
    to avoid division by zero.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> future_value_growing_annuity(1000, 0.05, 0.03, 10)

    """
    Calculates the future value of a two-stage growing investment.

    Parameters
    ----------
    D0 : float
        Initial investment per period.
