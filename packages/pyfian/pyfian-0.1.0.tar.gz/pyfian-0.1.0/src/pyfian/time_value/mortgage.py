    """
    Calculate the fixed payment per payment period for a mortgage.

    This function computes the payment amount due each payment period given
    the principal, annual interest rate, total loan term in months, and the
    interval between payments in months.

    Parameters
    ----------
    principal : float
        The original loan amount.
    annual_rate : float
        The annual nominal interest rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.04 for 4%).
    term_months : int
        The total loan term expressed in months.
    payment_interval_months : int
        The number of months between each payment (e.g., 1 for monthly).

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The fixed payment amount due each payment period.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If payment_interval_months is zero or negative, or if total_payments is zero.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> calculate_payment(200000, 0.04, 360, 1)
