    Description of how to write/change the configuration file.
    ==========================================================

    The configuration file is in JSON syntax.
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON
    The keywords and the nesting is important. The order of keywords
    have no significance (the examples use alphabetical order).
    Indentation and line breaks have no significance.

    The encoding for the configuration file must be UTF-8.
    (US-ACII is a subset of UTF-8.)

    It is recommended that you let the command generate a configuration
    file and then edit that file to match your needs. It is NOT recommended
    that the user writes the configuration file from scratch.

    Type of input file
    ==================

    The type of input file to read is determined by "infile_type".
    "infile_type" can have the values: '''
    msg += ' ,'.join(['"' + x.name + '"' for x in InFileType])
    msg += '''

    As both JSON and XML are syntax in text files, the text files can have an
    encoding for the text in the files.
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding
    This is specified with "infile_encoding".
    Unless you know that you need another encoding leave this as in the
    generated example configuration.

    Type of output file
    ===================

    The type of output file to produce is determined by "outfile_type".
    "outfile_type" can have the values:
    '''
    msg += ' ,'.join(['"' + x.name + '"' for x in OutFileType])
    msg += '''

    As CSV, TXT, JSON and XML are syntaxes in text files, the text files can
    have an encoding for the text in the files.
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding
    This is specified with "outfile_encoding". Unless you know that you need
    another encoding leave this as in the generated example configuration.

    Comma separated values files (CSV files) may differ slightly depending on
    the programs used to read/write them and the locale used.
    "out_csv_dialect" changes how CSV files are written. It is always needed
    in the configuration file, but is only used if the output is CSV.

    Excel files can be written using three libraries. "outfile_excel_library"
    can have values "OPENPYXL", "XLSXWRITER" or "PYLIGHTXL". These are
    different third party libraries that can read/write excel. My experience
    is that "PYLIGHTXL" most often is able to read and write excel
    files correctly. If you have trouble writing your particular excel file,
    please try another library.
    "outfile_excel_library" is always needed in the configuration file
    but is only used if the output is excel.

    Data to extract
    ===============

    The input files (JSON or XML) is likely to include a lot more data than
    what is interesting to extract. The data to extract is specified using
    "main_line" and "linked_lines" parameters in the configuration file.

    The "main_line" specifies what part of the input file should be the
    main part of the output line(s). The linked lines have some data linking
    them to the main line: A linked line is linked to the main line if
    some item in the linked line has the same value as some other item in
    the main line.

    The "line" sub-parameter of the the "main_line" and "linked_lines"
    configuration parameters includes a list of strings. This list of
    strings is the path of keywords to the records. Directly below this
    path is either a list or a dictionary of the records.

    The dictionary of the records of the "main_line" are indexed in the input
    (either by an integer index in the case of a list, or by the key in case
    of a dictionary). If you want this index (also known as key) to be
    included in the output, set configuration  parameter "include_key" to
    true. To exclude this index (key) from the output set "include_key" to
    false. The output column name for this key (index) is set using the
    configuration parameter "column_name_for_key".

    The "columns" sub-parameter of the "main_line" and "linked_lines"
    configuration parameters includes a dictionary from a string to a list of
    strings. The keys in this dictionary is the column names to use in the
    output. The list of strings is the relative path in the record of the item
    that has the value for this column.

    Sometimes a single record in the input, defined as the item in the list or
    dictionary referenced by the "line" sub-parameter, can contain several
    sub-records. For instance if the record is a purchase order, then the
    order may include several purchased items. As the output format of a list
    of columns does not support such nesting, the single input redord needs
    to be split into several output lines. The common items in the input
    record is then duplicated on all such lines split from the same input
    record. The configuration sub-parameter "expand_at" holds a list of
    relative paths where the input record should be expanded (or split).
    Each such relative path is configured using a list of strings in the
    "expand_at" sub-parameter. As the "expand_at" holds a list of relative
    paths (list of list of strings), this expansion can be configured to be
    done on zero, one or several places in the input record.

    There can be only one main line, denoted by the "main_line" configuration
    parameter. In contrast there may be any number of linked lines.
    The linked lines are described be an array for the the "linked_lines"
    configuration parameter. The sub-parameters described for the "main_line"
    shall also be configured for each item in the "linked_lines" array.

    How linked lines are tied to main line is defined by the "linked_column"
    and "linked_main_column" sub-parameter for each linked line item.
    Both "linked_column" and "linked_main_column" are relative paths in
    the input records using the familiar list of strings syntax.
    The "linked_column" sub-parameter denotes an item in the linked line
    record that shall have the same value as the item in the main line record
    denoted by the the "linked_main_column" sub-parameter.

    The data items used to link a linked line to a main line may be extracted
    to the output using the "column" sub-parameter, but this is totally
    optional. There is no requirement that the data items used to tie linked
    lines to main lines are part of the output.

    Several linked lines could be tied to the same main line. The
    configuration parameter "one_output_line_per_main_line" determines how
    this case is handled. If it is set to false, the result will be that
    the main line part is duplicated so that the output has one line for
    each tied combination of main line and linked lines.
    Sometimes this duplication of main line is not intended. By setting the
    configuration parameter "one_output_line_per_main_line" to true,
    several linked lines tied to one main line will be flagged as an error.

    As items in records are optional in the input formats (JSON and XML) it
    is possible the that there is no data at the paths specified for columns
    or specified for records.
    The configuration parameter "missing_input_for_column" determines how
    missing data in input is handled. The possible values are "EMPTY" and
    "ERROR". If configured as "EMPTY" the columns resulting from the missing
    input data will simply be empty.

    XML attributes
    ==============

    The XML syntax allows member values of an object to either be written as
    nested objects or as attributes. If the input has XML attributes the
    key for the attributes will have an "@" prepended. To handle this the
    configuration parameter "in_xml_strip_at" can be set to true or false.
    If "in_xml_strip_at" is set to true an "@" character in the beginning
    of any key will be stripped off.

    The configuration parameter "out_xml_attributes" specifies a list of
    column names. These columns will be written as XML attributes in XML
    output, not as nested objects.

    Output column order
    ===================

    The order of the columns in the output is specified with the configuration
    parameter "column_order". The value of this parameter is a list of
    strings.

    Specifying a column in the output column order that has not been extracted
    is an error. It is also an error to extract a column and not specify it
    in the output column order.

    Output line order
    =================

    The configuration parameter "order_rows_by" specifies that lines produced
    shall be sorted based on these columns. The most significant column shall
    be first in the list of column names.

    The default order or lines produced is to order them based on the list
    of columns in the "column_order" configuration parameter. Leave
    "order_rows_by" as empty list unless you have a reason to request
    another specific order than the default.
