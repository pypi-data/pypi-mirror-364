## A list of ideas for things to do

We can add to this list, and add notes when things have been done.
The goal is to find exercises which help to develop pomp-py while giving us practice with the practice and theory of diffPomp.

1. Modify the dacca model to take an arbitrary subset of times (up to 50*12)

2. How does the ADPF implemenation scale with the length of the time series (with LG and dacca)? Is this as you expect?

3. test_dacca.py and test_lg.py should be in the tests directory and should be run using some unit test commands. Set this up.

4. What other things can be done to nudge pomp-py in the direction of being a publishable software package?

5. How does the time scale with the number of particle, J? Is this what you expect?

6. Write a tutorial document on things you have tested out with pomp-py, to help others follow along.
