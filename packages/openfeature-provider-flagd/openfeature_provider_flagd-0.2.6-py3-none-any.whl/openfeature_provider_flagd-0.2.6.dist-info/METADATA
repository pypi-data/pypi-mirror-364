                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# flagd Provider for OpenFeature

This provider is designed to use flagd's [evaluation protocol](https://github.com/open-feature/schemas/blob/main/protobuf/schema/v1/schema.proto), or locally evaluate flags defined in a flagd [flag definition](https://github.com/open-feature/schemas/blob/main/json/flagd-definitions.json) via the OpenFeature Python SDK.

## Installation

```
pip install openfeature-provider-flagd
```

## Configuration and Usage

The flagd provider can operate in two modes: [RPC](#remote-resolver-rpc) (evaluation takes place in flagd, via gRPC calls) or [in-process](#in-process-resolver) (evaluation takes place in-process, with the provider getting a ruleset from a compliant sync-source).

### Remote resolver (RPC)

This is the default mode of operation of the provider.
In this mode, `FlagdProvider` communicates with [flagd](https://github.com/open-feature/flagd) via the gRPC protocol.
Flag evaluations take place remotely at the connected flagd instance.

Instantiate a new FlagdProvider instance and configure the OpenFeature SDK to use it:

```python
from openfeature import api
from openfeature.contrib.provider.flagd import FlagdProvider

api.set_provider(FlagdProvider())
```

### In-process resolver

This mode performs flag evaluations locally (in-process). Flag configurations for evaluation are obtained via gRPC protocol using [sync protobuf schema](https://buf.build/open-feature/flagd/file/main:sync/v1/sync_service.proto) service definition.

Consider the following example to create a `FlagdProvider` with in-process evaluations,

```python
from openfeature import api
from openfeature.contrib.provider.flagd import FlagdProvider
from openfeature.contrib.provider.flagd.config import ResolverType

api.set_provider(FlagdProvider(
    resolver_type=ResolverType.IN_PROCESS,
))
```

In the above example, in-process handlers attempt to connect to a sync service on address `localhost:8013` to obtain [flag definitions](https://github.com/open-feature/schemas/blob/main/json/flags.json).

<!--
#### Sync-metadata

To support the injection of contextual data configured in flagd for in-process evaluation, the provider exposes a `getSyncMetadata` accessor which provides the most recent value returned by the [GetMetadata RPC](https://buf.build/open-feature/flagd/docs/main:flagd.sync.v1#flagd.sync.v1.FlagSyncService.GetMetadata).
The value is updated with every (re)connection to the sync implementation.
This can be used to enrich evaluations with such data.
If the `in-process` mode is not used, and before the provider is ready, the `getSyncMetadata` returns an empty map.
-->
### File mode

In-process resolvers can also work in an offline mode.
To enable this mode, you should provide a valid flag configuration file with the option `offlineFlagSourcePath`.

```python
from openfeature import api
from openfeature.contrib.provider.flagd import FlagdProvider
from openfeature.contrib.provider.flagd.config import ResolverType

api.set_provider(FlagdProvider(
    resolver_type=ResolverType.FILE,
    offline_flag_source_path="my-flag.json",
))
```

Provider will attempt to detect file changes using polling.
Polling happens at 5 second intervals and this is currently unconfigurable.
This mode is useful for local development, tests and offline applications.

### Configuration options

The default options can be defined in the FlagdProvider constructor.

 -->

> [!NOTE]
> Some configurations are only applicable for RPC resolver.

<!--
### Unix socket support
Unix socket communication with flagd is facilitated by usaging of the linux-native `epoll` library on `linux-x86_64`
only (ARM support is pending the release of `netty-transport-native-epoll` v5).
Unix sockets are not supported on other platforms or architectures.
-->

### Reconnection

Reconnection is supported by the underlying gRPC connections.
If the connection to flagd is lost, it will reconnect automatically.
A failure to connect will result in an [error event](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/events#provider_error) from the provider, though it will attempt to reconnect indefinitely.

### Deadlines

Deadlines are used to define how long the provider waits to complete initialization or flag evaluations.
They behave differently based on the resolver type.

#### Deadlines with Remote resolver (RPC)

If the remote evaluation call is not completed within this deadline, the gRPC call is terminated with the error `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`
and the evaluation will default.

### TLS

TLS is available in situations where flagd is running on another host.


You may optionally supply an X.509 certificate in PEM format. Otherwise, the default certificate store will be used.

```python
from openfeature import api
