class Timer:
    """
    A timer with duration and elapsed time tracking.

    This class provides a simple timer mechanism for tracking elapsed
    time and determining when a timer has completed. It's commonly
    used for animations, delays, and time-based game mechanics.

    Arguments:
        `duration`: The total duration of the timer in milliseconds.

        `elapsed`: The elapsed time in milliseconds. Defaults to 0.

    Example:
        ```python
        # Create a 2-second timer
        timer = Timer(2000)

        # Update timer in game loop
        timer = timer.tick(time_delta)

        # Check if timer is complete
        if timer.complete:
            print("Timer finished!")
        ```

        """
        Tick the timer in a game loop.

        Advances the timer by the given time delta and returns a new
        timer instance with updated elapsed time.

        Arguments:
            `time_delta`: The time elapsed since the last tick in
                milliseconds.

        Returns:
            `Timer`: A new timer with elapsed time updated.

        Example:
            ```python
            timer = Timer(1000)  # 1 second timer
            timer = timer.tick(100)  # Advance by 100ms

        Get a reset timer.

        Creates a new timer instance with the same duration but
        elapsed time set to 0.

        Returns:
            `Timer`: A new timer with elapsed time set to 0.

        Example:
            ```python
            timer = Timer(1000, 500)  # 1s timer, 500ms elapsed
            reset_timer = timer.reset  # 1s timer, 0ms elapsed

        """
        Get whether the timer has completed.

        Returns:
            `bool`: Whether the timer has completed (elapsed >= duration).

        Example:
            ```python
            timer = Timer(1000, 1200)  # 1s timer, 1.2s elapsed

    Get the current time point in milliseconds.

    Returns the current time from pygame's clock, which is typically
    used for calculating time deltas in game loops.

    Returns:
        `Millisecond`: Current time in milliseconds.

    Example:
