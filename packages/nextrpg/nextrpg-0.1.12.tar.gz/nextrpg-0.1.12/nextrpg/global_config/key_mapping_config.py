"""
Key mapping configuration system for `nextrpg`.

This module provides configuration options for keyboard key mappings in `nextrpg`
games. It includes the `KeyMappingConfig` class for mapping game actions to
keyboard keys.

Features:
    - Type alias for key codes
    - Configurable key mappings for movement and actions
    - Integration with input handling system

"""
Type alias for keyboard key codes used in pygame.

This type alias represents integer constants that identify specific keys on the
keyboard (like K_LEFT, K_RIGHT, etc.) as defined by pygame. These codes are used
in key mapping configurations and event handling.

    """
    Configuration class for keyboard key mappings.

    This class defines the mapping between game actions and keyboard keys. Used
    by `nextrpg.event.pygame_event.KeyboardKey`, and the input handling system to
    translate keyboard input into game actions.

    Attributes:
        left: Key code for moving left. The default is `K_LEFT`.
        right: Key code for moving right. The default is `K_RIGHT`.
        up: Key code for moving up. The default is `K_UP`.
        down: Key code for moving down. The default is `K_DOWN`.
        confirm: Key code for confirming actions. The default is `K_SPACE`.
        gui_mode_toggle: Key code for toggling between windowed and full screen
            mode. The default is `F1`.
