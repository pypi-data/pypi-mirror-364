"""
Character configuration system for `nextrpg`.

This module provides configuration options for character behavior in
`nextrpg` games. It includes the `CharacterConfig` class which defines
movement, timing, and directional parameters for characters.

Features:
    - Movement speed configuration
    - Idle and move duration settings
    - Directional movement constraints
    - Integration with character systems

    """
    Configuration class for characters.

    This global_config is used by `nextrpg.character.character.Character` to define
    movement behavior, timing, and directional constraints.

    Arguments:
        move_speed: The default speed of the character's movement in pixels
            per millisecond. The number of pixels is consumed before screen
            scaling, if any. Defaults to 0.2.
        idle_duration: The duration of the NPC's idle state in milliseconds.
            Defaults to 500.
        move_duration: The duration of the NPC's move state in milliseconds.
            Defaults to 1000.
        directions: The set of directions that the character can move.
            Defaults to all directions (up, left, right, down, and diagonals).
