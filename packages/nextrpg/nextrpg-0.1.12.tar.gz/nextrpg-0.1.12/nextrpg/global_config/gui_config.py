"""
GUI configuration system for `nextrpg`.

This module provides configuration options for the graphical user interface in
`nextrpg` games. It includes enums for resize and GUI modes, and the
`GuiConfig` class for window and rendering settings.

Features:
    - Resize mode and GUI mode enums
    - Window size, title, and background color configuration
    - Frame rate and double buffering options
    - Windowed/fullscreen and scaling options
