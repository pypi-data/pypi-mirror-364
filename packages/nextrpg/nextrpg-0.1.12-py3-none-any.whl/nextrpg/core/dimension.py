"""
Core types and utilities used throughout the `nextrpg` framework.

This module provides fundamental data structures and utilities that are
referenced across the entire `nextrpg` framework. It includes:

- Color representation (`Rgba`)
- Directional movement (`Direction`, `DirectionalOffset`)
- Size and dimension handling (`Size`)
- Font management (`Font`)
- Timer utilities (`Timer`)
- Type aliases for common concepts

These types form the foundation for character movement, drawing, and game
mechanics throughout the framework.

type Pixel = int | float
"""
Number of pixel on screen.

`float` is allowed given Pygame supports passing `float` as `Rect`.
"""

type PixelPerMillisecond = int | float
"""
Used as a unit for speed.

class Size(namedtuple("Size", "width height")):
    """
    Represents the dimensions of a two-dimensional space.

    This class is immutable and designed to encapsulate the concept of size
    in pixel measurements. It provides utility methods for scaling and
    manipulation of dimensions.

    Arguments:
        `width`: The width of the size in pixels.

        `height`: The height of the size in pixels.

    Example:
        ```python
        # Create a size for a sprite
        sprite_size = Size(32, 32)

        # Scale the size
        scaled_size = sprite_size.scale(2.0)  # Returns Size(64, 64)
        ```
    """

    width: Pixel
    height: Pixel

    def scale(self, scaling: float) -> Self:
        """
        Scales the dimensions by a scaling factor and returns a new `Size`.

        The new dimensions are rounded up to the nearest integer to ensure
        that drawings won't leave tiny, black gaps after scaling.

        Arguments:
            `scaling`: A scaling factor by which the width and height will be
                multiplied.

        Returns:
            `Size`: A new `Size` object representing the scaled dimensions.

        Example:
            ```python
            size = Size(10, 20)
            scaled = size.scale(1.5)  # Returns Size(15, 30)
            ```
        """
        return Size(ceil(self.width * scaling), ceil(self.height * scaling))

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f"({self.width}, {self.height})"
