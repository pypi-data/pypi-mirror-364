"""
2D coordinate system for `nextrpg`.

This module provides a comprehensive 2D coordinate system for positioning and
movement in `nextrpg` games. It includes the `Coordinate` class which
represents positions in 2D space with support for directional movement,
scaling, and mathematical operations.

Features:
    - Immutable coordinate representation
    - Directional movement with `DirectionalOffset`
    - Distance calculations between coordinates
    - Direction calculation between two points
    - Coordinate arithmetic (addition, negation)
    - Support for both orthogonal and diagonal movement

    """
    Represents a 2D coordinate with immutability and mathematical operations.

    This class provides a comprehensive 2D coordinate system with support for
    directional movement, distance calculations, and coordinate arithmetic. It's
    designed to be immutable for thread safety and predictable behavior.

    The coordinate system uses a top-left origin where (0, 0) is the top-left
    corner of the screen, with positive x extending right and positive y
    extending down.

    Arguments:
        left: The horizontal position of the coordinate, measured by the number
            of pixels from the left edge of the game window.
        top: The vertical position of the coordinate, measured by the number of
            pixels from the top edge of the game window.

    def negate(self) -> Self:
        """
        Get the negated coordinate.

        Returns a new coordinate with both x and y components negated. This is
        useful for reversing directions or creating opposite positions.

        Returns:
            A new coordinate with negated components.

    def shift(self, offset: DirectionalOffset | Self) -> Self:
        """
        Shift the coordinate by a directional offset or add another coordinate.

        This method supports two modes of operation:
        1. Shifting by a `DirectionalOffset` for directional movement
        2. Adding another `Coordinate` for coordinate arithmetic

        For diagonal directions, the offset is divided proportionally using the
        square root of 2 to maintain consistent movement speed.

        Arguments:
            offset: A `DirectionalOffset` representing the direction and offset,
                or `Coordinate` to add to the current coordinate.

        Returns:
            A new coordinate shifted by the specified offset in the given
            direction.
