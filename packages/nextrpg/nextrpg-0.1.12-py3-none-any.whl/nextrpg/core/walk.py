"""
Path-based walking system for `NextRPG`.

This module provides a sophisticated walking system that allows characters and
objects to follow predefined paths with configurable movement speeds. The system
supports both linear and cyclic paths, with smooth movement interpolation
between path points.

The walking system includes:
- Path-based movement along polygon paths
- Configurable movement speed
- Support for cyclic (looping) and linear paths
- Smooth interpolation between path points
- Direction calculation based on movement
- Completion detection for linear paths

The system is designed to work seamlessly with the character movement and
animation systems, providing realistic path-following behavior.

    """
    Path-based walking system for characters and objects.

    This class provides a complete walking system that allows entities to follow
    predefined paths with smooth movement. It supports both linear paths (with
    completion) and cyclic paths (looping).

    The walking system calculates movement based on time deltas and movement
    speed, providing smooth interpolation between path points. It also tracks
    direction changes for animation purposes.

    Arguments:
        `path`: The polygon path to follow.
        `move_speed`: Movement speed in pixels per millisecond.
        `cyclic`: Whether the path should loop continuously. If `True`, the walk
            will restart from the beginning when reaching the end. If `False`,
            the walk will complete when reaching the end.
        `coordinate`: Current position on the path. Automatically initialized to
            the path's starting point.
        `_last_coordinate`: Previous position for direction calculation.
            Automatically initialized to the path's starting point.
        `_index`: Current path point index.
        `_last_index`: Previous path point index.
