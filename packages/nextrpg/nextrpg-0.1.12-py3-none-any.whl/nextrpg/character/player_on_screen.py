"""
Player character implementation for `nextrpg`.

This module provides the `PlayerOnScreen` class that handles player character
movement, input processing, and interaction with the game world. It extends the
base moving character functionality with keyboard input handling and
player-specific behaviors.

Features:
    - Keyboard input processing for movement
    - Eight-directional movement support
    - Key press and release event handling
    - Movement state management
    - Collision detection integration

    """
    Player character that responds to keyboard input for movement.

    This class extends `MovingCharacterOnScreen` to provide player-specific
    functionality including keyboard input processing, movement state
    management, and proper character direction handling based on
    currently pressed movement keys.

    The player supports movement in all eight directions (orthogonal
    and diagonal) with proper key combination handling. Movement
    keys are tracked and the character's direction is updated
    accordingly.

    Arguments:
        `_movement_keys`: Internal set of currently pressed movement keys.
            This is managed automatically by the event system.

    Example:
        ```python
        from nextrpg.player_on_screen import PlayerOnScreen
        from nextrpg.character_drawing import CharacterDrawing

        player = PlayerOnScreen(
            character=CharacterDrawing(drawing=player_sprite),
            coordinate=Coordinate(100, 100),
            collisions=map_collisions
        )

        # Handle keyboard events
        player = player.event(key_press_event)
