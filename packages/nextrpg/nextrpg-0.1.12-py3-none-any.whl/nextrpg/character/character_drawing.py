"""
Character drawing interface and base classes for `nextrpg`.

This module provides the foundational interface for character drawing and
animation in `nextrpg` games. It defines the abstract base class
`CharacterDrawing` that all character drawing implementations must inherit from.

Features:
    - Direction-based character orientation
    - Movement animation updates
    - Idle animation updates
    - Drawing state management

class CharacterDrawing(ABC):
    """
    Abstract interface for drawing characters on screen.

    This abstract base class defines the contract that all character drawing
    implementations must follow. It provides methods for character orientation,
    movement animation, and idle animation updates.

    The class is designed to be immutable, with all methods returning new
    instances rather than modifying the current state. This ensures thread
    safety and predictable behavior in the game loop.

    Arguments:
        direction: Initial character direction.

    def drawing(self) -> Drawing:
        """
        Get the character's current drawing representation.

        This method should return the appropriate drawing based on the
        character's current state, direction, and animation frame. The drawing
        should reflect the character's current appearance including any active
        animations.

        Returns:
            The character's current drawing representation.
        """

    @abstractmethod
    def turn(self, direction: Direction) -> Self:
        """
        Turn the character to face a specified direction.

        This method should handle direction changes and return a new character
        instance with the updated direction. The method may also trigger
        direction-specific animations or state changes.

        Arguments:
            direction: The new direction the character should face.

        Returns:
            A new character instance with the updated direction.

    @abstractmethod
    def tick_move(self, time_delta: Millisecond) -> Self:
        """
        Update the character's movement animation state.

        This method should advance the character's movement animation based on
        the elapsed time. It's called when the character is actively moving.

        Arguments:
            time_delta: The amount of time that has passed since the last update
                in milliseconds.

        Returns:
            A new character instance with updated movement animation state.
        """

    @abstractmethod
    def tick_idle(self, time_delta: Millisecond) -> Self:
        """
        Update the character's idle animation state.

        This method should advance the character's idle animation based on the
        elapsed time. It's called when the character is not moving.

        Arguments:
            time_delta: The amount of time that has passed since the last update
                in milliseconds.

        Returns:
            A new character instance with updated idle animation state.
