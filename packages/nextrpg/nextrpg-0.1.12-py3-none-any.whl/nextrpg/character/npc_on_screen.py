"""
NPC (Non-Player Character) system for `nextrpg`.

This module provides the core NPC functionality for the `nextrpg` game engine.
It includes classes for managing NPCs on screen, event specifications, and scene
management for player-NPC interactions.

Features:
    - `NpcOnScreen`: In-game NPC interface for stationary NPCs
    - `EventfulScene`: Scene that supports event execution via coroutines/generators
    - `RpgEventScene`: Scene wrapper for RPG events
    - `NpcSpec`: Base class for NPC specifications
    - Type aliases for event specifications and generators
