"""
Character on-screen representation for `nextrpg`.

This module provides the base classes for characters that can be displayed and
interacted with on screen. It includes character specifications, on-screen
character management, and event handling for character interactions.

Features:
    - Character specification and configuration
    - On-screen character positioning and drawing
    - Event interaction handling
    - Character state management
    - Visual representation management

    Specification for a character's properties and configuration.

    This class defines the basic properties of a character including its object

    creating character instances.

    Arguments:
        object_name: The unique identifier for the character object. Used for
            map object references and event triggers.
        display_name: The name displayed to the player for this character.
            Defaults to the object_name if not specified.

    Represents a character that can be displayed and interacted with on screen.

    This class provides the foundation for all on-screen characters, including
    positioning, drawing management, event handling, and state management. It
    serves as the base class for both player characters and NPCs.

    The character maintains its position, visual representation, and event
    interaction capabilities. It can be updated over time and can participate
    in event-driven interactions with other characters or game elements.

    Arguments:
        spec: The character specification defining the character's properties
            and visual representation.
        coordinate: The current position of the character on screen.
        name: The display name of the character. Defaults to the specification's
            display name.
        character: The character drawing that defines the visual representation.
            Defaults to the specification's character.
        _event_triggered: Internal flag indicating if the character is currently
            participating in an event.
