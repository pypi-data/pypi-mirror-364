"""
Event attribute system for `nextrpg`.

This module provides a proxy class that allows RPG events to be accessed as
attributes on scenes and other objects. It includes the `EventAsAttr` class
which dynamically resolves event names to registered event handlers.

Features:
    - Dynamic event resolution
    - Attribute-style event access
    - Integration with registered events
    - Error handling for missing events
