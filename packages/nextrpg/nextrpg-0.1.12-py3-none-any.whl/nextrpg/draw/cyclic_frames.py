"""
Frame-based animation system for `nextrpg`.

This module provides a frame-based animation system that allows static drawings
to be played sequentially to create animated effects. It includes the
`CyclicFrames` class for managing frame sequences with configurable timing.

Features:
    - Sequential frame playback with timing control
    - Cyclic animation loops
    - Configurable frame duration
    - Timer-based frame advancement
    - Animation state management

        duration_per_frame: Time to display each frame in milliseconds.
        _index: Current frame index in the sequence.
