        scheme (str): The coarse graining scheme to use. Options include 'Average Distance' and other custom schemes.
        mass_weighted (bool): If True and using 'Average Distance', weights the average by atomic mass.
        include_h (bool): If True, includes hydrogen atoms in the calculations; otherwise, excludes them.
        therm_cush (float): A thermal cushion factor that might be used for adjusting calculations (not used in this code).

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the calculated location and radius of the sphere representing the group of atoms.

    Notes:
        - If only one atom is provided, the function directly returns its location and radius.
        - Excluding hydrogen atoms can be useful for focusing on heavier atoms in structural representations.
        - The 'Average Distance' scheme calculates an average sphere either mass-weighted or not, depending on the flag.
        - The function allows for extension with other schemes and modifications like thermal cushions.
