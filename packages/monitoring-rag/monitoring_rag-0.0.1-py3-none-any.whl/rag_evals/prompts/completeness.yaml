# Completeness Metric Prompts
# Evaluating comprehensive coverage of question aspects

completeness:
  _type: prompt
  simple_prompt:
    template: |
      You are an expert evaluator. Evaluate how completely the given answer addresses all aspects of the question.

      Question: {query}
      Answer: {answer}
      Context: {context}

      Rate completeness on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 where:
      - 1.0: Answer comprehensively addresses all aspects of the question
      - 0.5: Answer addresses some aspects but misses important elements
      - 0.0: Answer fails to address key aspects of the question

      Score: [Your score from 0.0 to 1.0]
      Reasoning: [Explain what aspects are covered and what might be missing]
    input_variables: ["query", "answer", "context"]
  
  aspect_prompt:
    template: |
      Identify the key aspects that should be addressed for this question:

      Question: {query}
      Context: {context}

      List the important aspects that a complete answer should cover:
      1. [First key aspect]
      2. [Second key aspect]
      ...

      Key Aspects:
    input_variables: ["query", "context"]
  
  coverage_prompt:
    template: |
      Evaluate how well the answer covers each identified aspect:

      Question: {query}
      Answer: {answer}
      Key Aspects: {aspects}

      For each aspect, assess coverage:
      1. [Aspect 1]: [FULLY_COVERED/PARTIALLY_COVERED/NOT_COVERED] - [Brief explanation]
      2. [Aspect 2]: [FULLY_COVERED/PARTIALLY_COVERED/NOT_COVERED] - [Brief explanation]
      ...

      Overall Completeness Score (0.0-1.0): [Score]
