## Cycls: The AI App Generator
Cycls[^1] streamlines AI application development by generating apps from high-level descriptions. It eliminates boilerplate, ensures cross-platform compatibility, and manages memory - all from a single codebase.

With Cycls, you can quickly prototype ideas and then turn them into production apps, while focusing on AI logic and user interactions rather than wrestling with implementation details.

## ‚ú® Core Features
- **Fast App Generation**: Create live web apps from code in minutes
- **Built-in Memory Management**: Integrated state and session management
- **Rich Hypermedia Content**: Support for various media types (text, images, audio, video, interactive elements)
- **Framework Agnostic**: Compatible with a wide range of AI frameworks and models

## üöÄ Quickstart
### Installation
```
pip install cycls
```

### Basic usage
```py
from cycls import Cycls

cycls = Cycls()

@cycls("@my-app")
def app():
    return "Hello World!"

cycls.push()
```
This creates an app named "@my-app" that responds with "Hello World!".

The `@cycls("@my-app")` decorator registers your app, and `cycls.push()` streams it to Cycls platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use a unique name for your app (like "@my-app"). This is your app's identifier on Cycls.

> [!NOTE]
> Your apps run on your infrastructure and are streamed in real-time to Cycls.
