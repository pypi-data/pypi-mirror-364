# smartrun
*Run any Python script in a clean, disposable virtual environment — automatically.*


# smartrun 🚀

**Run Python and Jupyter files with zero setup, zero pollution. Just run it.**

`smartrun` scans your script or notebook, detects the required third-party packages, creates (or reuses) an isolated environment, installs what’s missing — and runs your code.

✅ No more `ModuleNotFoundError`  
✅ No more cluttered global `site-packages`  
✅ Just clean, reproducible execution — every time

## Features

- 🧪 Supports both `.py` and `.ipynb` files
- 🔍 Automatically detects and resolves imports
- 🛠️ Uses `venv` or fast `uv` environments (if available)
- 📦 Installs only what's needed, only when needed
- 💡 Reuses environments smartly to save time

---
## Installation
```bash
pip install smartrun
```
> **Requires Python 3.10+**
---

## Usage

```bash
smartrun your_script.py
## Notebook
```bash
smartrun your_notebook.ipynb

```

## Example file that we want to run

```python
#some_file.py
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from rich import print 

df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(5, 3), columns=list("ABC"))
print("Data:")
print(df, end="\n\n")
print("Column means:")
print(df.mean())
```
## Create an environment 
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
✅ Activate the environment:
Windows
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
macOS/Linux
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
💡 Tip: smartrun handles environment creation automatically, but you’re free to manage it yourself.

✅ Run the script:
```bash
smartrun some_file.py
```
If any required package is missing, smartrun will install it for you.


## Why smartrun?

Because setup should never block you from running great code.
Whether you're experimenting, prototyping, or sharing — smartrun ensures your script runs smoothly, without dependency drama.
