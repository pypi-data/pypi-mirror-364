Scikit-Sampling (or `sksampling`) is a Python library for dataset sampling techniques. It provides a unified API for common sampling strategies, making it easy to integrate into your data science and machine learning workflows.

## Installation

You can install `sksampling` using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-sampling
```

## Features

`sksampling` offers a range of sampling methods, including:

- `sample_size`: Computes the ideal sample size based on confidence level and margin of error.
- `confidence_level`: Calculates the confidence level for a given sample size.

## Documentation

For detailed information on the library's functions, including parameters and usage examples, please see our documentation in the `docs/` folder.

A good place to start is the ðŸ“‘ [Estimation Functions Guide](docs/estimation.md).

We are continuously working on expanding our documentation to cover all features.
