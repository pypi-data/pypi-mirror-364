`folder2md4llms` is a powerful and flexible tool that converts a repository's contents into a single, LLM-friendly Markdown file. It's designed to be fast, configurable, and easy to use, with a focus on producing high-quality, structured output.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Smart Condensing**: Automatically condenses code to fit within a specified token or character limit without crude truncation.
- **Document Conversion**: Converts PDF, DOCX, XLSX, and other document formats into text.
- **Binary File Analysis**: Provides intelligent descriptions for images, archives, and other binary files.
- **Highly Configurable**: Use a `folder2md.yaml` file or command-line options to customize the output.
- **Fast and Efficient**: Leverages multi-threading and efficient file processing to handle large repositories quickly.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Uses `.gitignore`-style patterns to exclude files and directories.
