**mi.h - NVMe Management Interface library (libnvme-mi) definitions.**


These provide an abstraction for the MI messaging between controllers
and a host, typically over an MCTP-over-i2c link to a NVMe device, used
as part of the out-of-band management of a system.

We have a few data structures define here to reflect the topology
of a MI connection with an NVMe subsystem:

 - :c:type:`nvme_mi_ep_t`: an MI endpoint - our mechanism of communication with a
   NVMe subsystem. For MCTP, an endpoint will be the component that
   holds the MCTP address (EID), and receives our request message.

   endpoints are defined in the NVMe-MI spec, and are specific to the MI
   interface.

   Each endpoint will provide access to one or more of:

 - :c:type:`nvme_mi_ctrl_t`: a NVMe controller, as defined by the NVMe base spec.
   The controllers are responsible for processing any NVMe standard
   commands (eg, the Admin command set). An endpoint (:c:type:`nvme_mi_ep_t`)
   may provide access to multiple controllers - so each of the controller-
   type commands will require a :c:type:`nvme_mi_ctrl_t` to be specified, rather than
   an endpoint

A couple of conventions with the libnvme-mi API:

 - All types and functions have the nvme_mi prefix, to distinguish from
   the libnvme core.

 - We currently support either MI commands and Admin commands. The
   former adds a _mi prefix, the latter an _admin prefix. [This does
   result in the MI functions having a double _mi, like
   :c:type:`nvme_mi_mi_subsystem_health_status_poll`, which is apparently amusing
   for our German-speaking readers]

For return values: unless specified in the per-function documentation,
all functions:

 - return 0 on success

 - return -1, with errno set, for errors communicating with the MI device,
   either in request or response data

 - return >1 on MI status errors. This value is the 8-bit MI status
   value, represented by :c:type:`enum nvme_mi_resp_status <nvme_mi_resp_status>`. Note that the
   status values may be vendor-defined above 0xe0.

For the second case, we have a few conventions for errno values:

 - EPROTO: response data violated the MI protocol, and libnvme cannot
   validly interpret the response

 - EIO: Other I/O error communicating with device (eg., valid but
   unexpected response data)

 - EINVAL: invalid input arguments for a command

In line with the core NVMe API, the Admin command functions take an
`_args` structure to provide the command-specific parameters. However,
for the MI interface, the fd and timeout members of these _args structs
are ignored.

References to the specifications here will either to be the NVM Express
Management Interface ("NVMe-MI") or the NVM Express Base specification
("NVMe"). At the time of writing, the versions we're referencing here
are:
 - NVMe-MI 1.2b
 - NVMe 2.0b
with a couple of accommodations for older spec types, particularly NVMe-MI
1.1, where possible.

the eventual response data, with a specification-defined maximum of 65.535
seconds.

This function provides a way to limit the maximum time we're prepared to
wait for the final response. Specify zero in **mprt_max_ms** for no limit.
This should be larger than the command/response timeout set in
:c:type:`nvme_mi_ep_set_timeout`().

  :c:type:`nvme_mi_ep_t` containing endpoints

``c``
  :c:type:`nvme_mi_ctrl_t` object, set on each iteration

**Description**

Allows iteration of the list of controllers behind an endpoint. Unless the
controllers have already been created explicitly, you'll probably want to
call :c:type:`nvme_mi_scan_ep`() to scan for the controllers first.

See: :c:type:`nvme_mi_scan_ep`()


.. c:macro:: nvme_mi_for_each_ctrl_safe

``nvme_mi_for_each_ctrl_safe (ep, c, _c)``

**Description**

Allows iteration of the list of controllers behind an endpoint, safe against
deletion during iteration. Unless the controllers have already been created
explicitly (or you're just iterating to destroy controllers) you'll probably
want to call :c:type:`nvme_mi_scan_ep`() to scan for the controllers first.

See: :c:type:`nvme_mi_scan_ep`()


.. c:function:: nvme_mi_ep_t nvme_mi_open_mctp (nvme_root_t root, unsigned int netid, uint8_t eid)

**Description**

This function queries the system MCTP daemon ("mctpd") over
D-Bus, to find MCTP endpoints that report support for NVMe-MI over MCTP.

This requires libvnme-mi to be compiled with D-Bus support; if not, this
will return NULL.

**Return**

A **nvme_root_t** populated with a set of MCTP-connected endpoints,
        or NULL on failure


.. c:function:: int nvme_mi_scan_ep (nvme_mi_ep_t ep, bool force_rescan)

   query an endpoint for its NVMe controllers.

**Parameters**

``nvme_mi_ep_t ep``
  Endpoint to scan

``bool force_rescan``
  close existing controllers and rescan

**Description**

This function queries an MI endpoint for the controllers available, by
performing an MI Read MI Data Structure command (requesting the
controller list). The controllers are stored in the endpoint's internal
list, and can be iterated with nvme_mi_for_each_ctrl.

This will only scan the endpoint once, unless **force_rescan** is set. If
so, all existing controller objects will be freed - the caller must not
hold a reference to those across this call.

See: :c:type:`nvme_mi_for_each_ctrl`

**Return**

The nvme command status if a response was received (see
:c:type:`enum nvme_status_field <nvme_status_field>`) or -1 with errno set otherwise.

:c:type:`nvme_mi_mi_read_mi_data_ctrl_list`.

See :c:type:`nvme_mi_close_ctrl`

**Return**

New controller object, or NULL on failure.


.. c:function:: void nvme_mi_close_ctrl (nvme_mi_ctrl_t ctrl)

   free a controller

**Parameters**

``nvme_mi_ctrl_t ctrl``

``nvme_mi_ctrl_t ctrl``
  controller to query

**Description**

Retrieve the ID of the controller, as defined by hardware, and available
in the Identify (Controller List) data. This is the value passed to
**nvme_mi_init_ctrl**, but may have been created internally via
**nvme_mi_scan_ep**.

**Return**

the (locally-stored) ID of this controller.


.. c:function:: char * nvme_mi_endpoint_desc (nvme_mi_ep_t ep)

   Get a string describing a MI endpoint.

**Parameters**

``nvme_mi_ep_t ep``
  endpoint to describe

**Description**

Generates a human-readable string describing the endpoint, with possibly
transport-specific data. The string is allocated during the call, and the
caller is responsible for free()-ing the string.

**Return**

a newly-allocated string containing the endpoint description, or
        NULL on failure.


.. c:function:: int nvme_mi_mi_xfer (nvme_mi_ep_t ep, struct nvme_mi_mi_req_hdr *mi_req, size_t req_data_size, struct nvme_mi_mi_resp_hdr *mi_resp, size_t *resp_data_size)

``struct nvme_mi_mi_resp_hdr *mi_resp``
  buffer for response data

``size_t *resp_data_size``
  size of response data buffer, updated to received size

**Description**

Performs an arbitrary NVMe MI command, using the provided request data,
in **mi_req**. The size of the request data *payload* is specified in
**req_data_size** - this does not include the standard header length (so a
header-only request would have a size of 0). Note that the Management
Request Doublewords are considered part of the header data.

On success, response data is stored in **mi_resp**, which has an optional
appended payload buffer of **resp_data_size** bytes. The actual payload
size transferred will be stored in **resp_data_size**. This size does not
include the MI response header, so 0 represents no payload.

See: :c:type:`struct nvme_mi_mi_req_hdr <nvme_mi_mi_req_hdr>` and :c:type:`struct nvme_mi_mi_resp_hdr <nvme_mi_mi_resp_hdr>`.

``struct nvme_mi_aem_config *config``
  AE configuraiton including which events are enabled and the callback function

``void *userdata``
  Application provided context pointer for callback function

**Description**

This function is called to enable AE on the endpoint.  Endpoint will provide initial state
(if any) of enabled AEs and application can parse those via the aem_handler fn pointer in
callbacks.  Thes can be obtained in the callback by calling nvme_mi_aem_get_next_event().

Application should poll the fd that can be obtained from nvme_mi_aem_get_fd and then call
nvme_mi_aem_process() when poll() indicates data available.

A call to nvme_mi_aem_process() will grab AEM data and call the aem_handler fn pointer.
At this point the application can call nvme_mi_aem_get_next_event() to get information for
each triggered event.

**Return**

0 is a success, nonzero is an error and errno may be read for further details


.. c:function:: int nvme_mi_aem_get_enabled (nvme_mi_ep_t ep, struct nvme_mi_aem_enabled_map *enabled)

  Endpoint to process

``void *userdata``
  Application provided context pointer for callback function

**Description**

Call this if poll() indicates data is available on the fd provided by nvme_mi_aem_get_fd()

This will call the fn pointer, aem_handler, provided with nvme_mi_aem_config and the
application can call nvme_mi_aem_get_next_event() from within this callback to get
aem event data.  The callback function should return NVME_MI_AEM_HNA_ACK for normal operation.

**Return**

0 is a success, nonzero is an error and errno may be read for further details
