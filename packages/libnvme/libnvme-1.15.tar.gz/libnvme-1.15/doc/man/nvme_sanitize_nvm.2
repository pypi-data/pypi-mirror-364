.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A sanitize operation alters all user data in the NVM subsystem such that
recovery of any previous user data from any cache, the non-volatile media,
or any Controller Memory Buffer is not possible.

The Sanitize command starts a sanitize operation or to recover from a
previously failed sanitize operation. The sanitize operation types that may
be supported are Block Erase, Crypto Erase, and Overwrite. All sanitize
operations are processed in the background, i.e., completion of the sanitize
command does not indicate completion of the sanitize operation.
.SH "RETURN"
The nvme command status if a response was received (see
\fIenum nvme_status_field\fP) or -1 with errno set otherwise.
