.SH Members
.IP "sprog" 12
Sanitize Progress (SPROG): indicates the fraction complete of the
sanitize operation. The value is a numerator of the fraction
complete that has 65,536 (10000h) as its denominator. This value
shall be set to FFFFh if the \fIsstat\fP field is not set to
NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_STATUS_IN_PROGESS.
.IP "sstat" 12
Sanitize Status (SSTAT): indicates the status associated with
the most recent sanitize operation. See \fIenum nvme_sanitize_sstat\fP.
.IP "scdw10" 12
Sanitize Command Dword 10 Information (SCDW10): contains the value
of the Command Dword 10 field of the Sanitize command that started
the sanitize operation.
.IP "eto" 12
Estimated Time For Overwrite: indicates the number of seconds required
to complete an Overwrite sanitize operation with 16 passes in
the background when the No-Deallocate Modifies Media After Sanitize
field is not set to 10b. A value of 0h indicates that the sanitize
operation is expected to be completed in the background when the
Sanitize command that started that operation is completed. A value
of FFFFFFFFh indicates that no time period is reported.
.IP "etbe" 12
Estimated Time For Block Erase: indicates the number of seconds
required to complete a Block Erase sanitize operation in the
background when the No-Deallocate Modifies Media After Sanitize
field is not set to 10b. A value of 0h indicates that the sanitize
operation is expected to be completed in the background when the
Sanitize command that started that operation is completed.
A value of FFFFFFFFh indicates that no time period is reported.
.IP "etce" 12
Estimated Time For Crypto Erase: indicates the number of seconds
required to complete a Crypto Erase sanitize operation in the
background when the No-Deallocate Modifies Media After Sanitize
field is not set to 10b. A value of 0h indicates that the sanitize
operation is expected to be completed in the background when the
Sanitize command that started that operation is completed.
A value of FFFFFFFFh indicates that no time period is reported.
.IP "etond" 12
Estimated Time For Overwrite With No-Deallocate Media Modification:
indicates the number of seconds required to complete an Overwrite
sanitize operation and the associated additional media modification
after the Overwrite sanitize operation in the background when
the No-Deallocate After Sanitize bit was set to 1 in the Sanitize
command that requested the Overwrite sanitize operation; and
the No-Deallocate Modifies Media After Sanitize field is set to 10b.
A value of 0h indicates that the sanitize operation is expected
to be completed in the background when the Sanitize command that
started that operation is completed. A value of FFFFFFFFh indicates
that no time period is reported.
.IP "etbend" 12
Estimated Time For Block Erase With No-Deallocate Media Modification:
indicates the number of seconds required to complete a Block Erase
sanitize operation and the associated additional media modification
after the Block Erase sanitize operation in the background when
the No-Deallocate After Sanitize bit was set to 1 in the Sanitize
command that requested the Overwrite sanitize operation; and
the No-Deallocate Modifies Media After Sanitize field is set to 10b.
A value of 0h indicates that the sanitize operation is expected
to be completed in the background when the Sanitize command that
started that operation is completed. A value of FFFFFFFFh indicates
that no time period is reported.
.IP "etcend" 12
Estimated Time For Crypto Erase With No-Deallocate Media Modification:
indicates the number of seconds required to complete a Crypto Erase
sanitize operation and the associated additional media modification
after the Crypto Erase sanitize operation in the background when
the No-Deallocate After Sanitize bit was set to 1 in the Sanitize
command that requested the Overwrite sanitize operation; and
the No-Deallocate Modifies Media After Sanitize field is set to 10b.
A value of 0h indicates that the sanitize operation is expected
to be completed in the background when the Sanitize command that
started that operation is completed. A value of FFFFFFFFh indicates
that no time period is reported.
.IP "etpvds" 12
Estimated Time For Post-Verification Deallocation State: indicates the
number of seconds required to deallocate all media allocated for user data
after exiting the Media Verification state (i.e., the time difference between
entering and exiting the Post-Verification Deallocation state), if that state
is entered as part of the sanitize operation. A value of FFFFFFFFh indicates
that no time period is reported.
.IP "ssi" 12
Sanitize State Information: indicate the state of the Sanitize Operation
State Machine.
