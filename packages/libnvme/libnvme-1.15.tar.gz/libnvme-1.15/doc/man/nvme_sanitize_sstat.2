sanitized.
.IP "NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_STATUS_COMPLETE_SUCCESS" 12
The most recent sanitize operation
completed successfully including any
additional media modification.
.IP "NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_STATUS_IN_PROGESS" 12

or since the most recent successful sanitize
operation.
.IP "NVME_SANITIZE_SSTAT_MVCNCLD_SHIFT" 12
Shift amount to get the value of Media Verification
Canceled bit of Sanitize status field.
