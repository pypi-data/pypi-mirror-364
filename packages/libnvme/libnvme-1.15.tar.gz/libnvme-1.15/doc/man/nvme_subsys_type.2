.IP "NVME_NQN_DISC" 12
Discovery type target subsystem. Describes a referral to another
Discovery Service composed of Discovery controllers that provide
additional discovery records. Multiple Referral entries may
be reported for each Discovery Service (if that Discovery Service
has multiple NVM subsystem ports or supports multiple protocols).
.IP "NVME_NQN_NVME" 12
NVME type target subsystem. Describes an NVM subsystem whose
controllers may have attached namespaces (an NVM subsystem
that is not composed of Discovery controllers). Multiple NVM
Subsystem entries may be reported for each NVM subsystem if
that NVM subsystem has multiple NVM subsystem ports.
.IP "NVME_NQN_CURR" 12
Current Discovery type target subsystem. Describes this Discovery
subsystem (the Discovery Service that contains the controller
processing the Get Log Page command). Multiple Current Discovery
Subsystem entries may be reported for this Discovery subsystem
if the current Discovery subsystem has multiple NVM subsystem
ports.
