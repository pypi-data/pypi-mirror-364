nvme_get_ana_log_atomic \- Retrieve Asymmetric Namespace Access log page atomically
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "int" nvme_get_ana_log_atomic
.BI "(int fd "  ","
.BI "bool rgo "  ","
.BI "bool rae "  ","
.BI "unsigned int retries "  ","
.BI "struct nvme_ana_log *log "  ","
.BI "__u32 *len "  ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "fd" 12
File descriptor of nvme device
.IP "rgo" 12
Whether to retrieve ANA groups only (no NSIDs)
.IP "rae" 12
Whether to retain asynchronous events
.IP "retries" 12
The maximum number of times to retry on log page changes
.IP "log" 12
Pointer to a buffer to receive the ANA log page
.IP "len" 12
Input: the length of the log page buffer.
Output: the actual length of the ANA log page.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
See \fIstruct nvme_ana_log\fP for the definition of the returned structure.
.SH "RETURN"
If successful, returns 0 and sets *len to the actual log page length.
If unsuccessful, returns the nvme command status if a response was received
(see \fIenum nvme_status_field\fP) or -1 with errno set otherwise.
Sets errno = EINVAL if retries == 0.
Sets errno = EAGAIN if unable to read the log page atomically
because chgcnt changed during each of the retries attempts.
Sets errno = ENOSPC if the full log page does not fit in the provided buffer.
