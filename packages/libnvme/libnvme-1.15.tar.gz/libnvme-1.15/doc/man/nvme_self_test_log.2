.IP "current_operation" 12
Current Device Self-Test Operation: indicates the status
of the current device self-test operation. If a device
self-test operation is in process (i.e., this field is set
to #NVME_ST_CURR_OP_SHORT or #NVME_ST_CURR_OP_EXTENDED),
then the controller shall not set this field to
#NVME_ST_CURR_OP_NOT_RUNNING until a new Self-test Result
Data Structure is created (i.e., if a device self-test
operation completes or is aborted, then the controller
shall create a Self-test Result Data Structure prior to
setting this field to #NVME_ST_CURR_OP_NOT_RUNNING).
See \fIenum nvme_st_curr_op\fP.
.IP "completion" 12
Current Device Self-Test Completion: indicates the percentage
of the device self-test operation that is complete (e.g.,
a value of 25 indicates that 25% of the device self-test
operation is complete and 75% remains to be tested).
If the \fIcurrent_operation\fP field is cleared to
#NVME_ST_CURR_OP_NOT_RUNNING (indicating there is no device
self-test operation in progress), then this field is ignored.
