# Sampling

This library contains some of the most common sampling procedures
together with some more advanced sampling methods,
both for tabular data and for spatial data.


A part of the library is the Python porting of
[sampling R package by Yves Tillé and Alina Mattei](
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sampling/versions/2.10),
the methods are described in 
["Sampling algorithms" by Tillé](
