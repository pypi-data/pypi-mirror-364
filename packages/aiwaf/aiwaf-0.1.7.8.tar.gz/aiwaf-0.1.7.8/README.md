# AI‑WAF

> A self‑learning, Django‑friendly Web Application Firewall  
> with rate‑limiting, anomaly detection, honeypots, UUID‑tamper protection, dynamic keyword extraction, file‑extension probing detection, exempt path awareness, and daily retraining.

---

## System Requirements

No GPU needed—AI-WAF runs entirely on CPU with just Python 3.8+, Django 3.2+, a single vCPU and ~512 MB RAM for small sites; for moderate production traffic you can bump to 2–4 vCPUs and 2–4 GB RAM, offload the daily detect-and-train job to a worker, and rotate logs to keep memory use bounded.

## 🚀 Features

- **IP Blocklist**  
  Instantly blocks suspicious IPs (supports CSV fallback or Django model).

- **Rate Limiting**  
  Sliding‑window blocks flooders (> `AIWAF_RATE_MAX` per `AIWAF_RATE_WINDOW`), then blacklists them.

- **AI Anomaly Detection**  
  IsolationForest trained on:
  - Path length  
  - Keyword hits (static + dynamic)  
  - Response time  
  - Status‑code index  
  - Burst count  
  - Total 404s  

- **Dynamic Keyword Extraction & Cleanup**  
  - Every retrain adds top 10 keyword segments from 4xx/5xx paths  
  - **If a path is added to `AIWAF_EXEMPT_PATHS`, its keywords are automatically removed from the database**

- **File‑Extension Probing Detection**  
  Tracks repeated 404s on common extensions (e.g. `.php`, `.asp`) and blocks IPs.

- **Honeypot Field**  
  Hidden field for bot detection → IP blacklisted on fill.

- **UUID Tampering Protection**  
  Blocks guessed or invalid UUIDs that don’t resolve to real models.


**Exempt Path & IP Awareness**

**Exempt Paths:**
Set `AIWAF_EXEMPT_PATHS` in your Django `settings.py` (not in your code). Fully respects this setting across all modules — exempt paths are:
  - Skipped from keyword learning
  - Immune to AI blocking
  - Ignored in log training
  - Cleaned from `DynamicKeyword` model automatically

**Exempt IPs:**
You can exempt specific IP addresses from all blocking and blacklisting logic. Exempted IPs will:
  - Never be added to the blacklist (even if they trigger rules)
  - Be automatically removed from the blacklist during retraining
  - Bypass all block/deny logic in middleware

### Managing Exempt IPs

Add an IP to the exemption list using the management command:

```bash
python manage.py add_ipexemption <ip-address> --reason "optional reason"
```

This will ensure the IP is never blocked by AI‑WAF. You can also manage exemptions via the Django admin interface.

- **Daily Retraining**  
  Reads rotated logs, auto‑blocks 404 floods, retrains the IsolationForest, updates `model.pkl`, and evolves the keyword DB.

## ⚙️ Configuration (`settings.py`)

```python
INSTALLED_APPS += ["aiwaf"]
```

### Database Setup

After adding `aiwaf` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`, run the following to create the necessary tables:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations aiwaf
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### Required

```python
AIWAF_ACCESS_LOG = "/var/log/nginx/access.log"
```

---

### Optional (defaults shown)

```python
AIWAF_MODEL_PATH         = BASE_DIR / "aiwaf" / "resources" / "model.pkl"
AIWAF_HONEYPOT_FIELD     = "hp_field"
AIWAF_RATE_WINDOW        = 10         # seconds
AIWAF_RATE_MAX           = 20         # max requests per window
AIWAF_RATE_FLOOD         = 10         # flood threshold
AIWAF_WINDOW_SECONDS     = 60         # anomaly detection window
AIWAF_FILE_EXTENSIONS    = [".php", ".asp", ".jsp"]
AIWAF_EXEMPT_PATHS = [          # optional but highly recommended
    "/favicon.ico",
    "/robots.txt",
    "/static/",
    "/media/",
    "/health/",
]
```

> **Note:** You no longer need to define `AIWAF_MALICIOUS_KEYWORDS` or `AIWAF_STATUS_CODES` — they evolve dynamically.

---

## 🧱 Middleware Setup

Add in **this** order to your `MIDDLEWARE` list:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    "aiwaf.middleware.IPAndKeywordBlockMiddleware",
    "aiwaf.middleware.RateLimitMiddleware",
    "aiwaf.middleware.AIAnomalyMiddleware",
    "aiwaf.middleware.HoneypotMiddleware",
    "aiwaf.middleware.UUIDTamperMiddleware",
    # ... other middleware ...
]
```

---

## 🕵️ Honeypot Field (in your template)

```django
{% load aiwaf_tags %}

<form method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}
  {% honeypot_field %}
  <!-- your real fields -->
</form>
```

> Renders a hidden `<input name="hp_field" style="display:none">`.  
> Any non‑empty submission → IP blacklisted.

---

## 🔁 Running Detection & Training

```bash
python manage.py detect_and_train
```

### What happens:
1. Read access logs (incl. rotated or gzipped)
2. Auto‑block IPs with ≥ 6 total 404s
3. Extract features & train IsolationForest
4. Save `model.pkl`
5. Extract top 10 dynamic keywords from 4xx/5xx
6. Remove any keywords associated with newly exempt paths

## 🧠 How It Works

| Middleware                         | Purpose                                                         |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| IPAndKeywordBlockMiddleware        | Blocks requests from known blacklisted IPs and Keywords         |
| RateLimitMiddleware                | Enforces burst & flood thresholds                               |
| AIAnomalyMiddleware                | ML‑driven behavior analysis + block on anomaly                  |
| HoneypotMiddleware                 | Detects bots filling hidden inputs in forms                     |
| UUIDTamperMiddleware               | Blocks guessed/nonexistent UUIDs across all models in an app    |
