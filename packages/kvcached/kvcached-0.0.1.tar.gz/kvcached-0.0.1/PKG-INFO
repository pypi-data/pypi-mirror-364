# kvcached

kvcached is a new KV cache management system that supports on-demand KV cache allocation. It implements the concept of GPU virtual memory, allowing applications to reserve virtual address space without immediately committing physical memory. Physical memory is then automatically allocated and mapped as needed at runtime. This capability allows multiple LLMs to run concurrently on a single GPU or a group of GPUs (TP) and flexibly share the GPU memory, significantly improving GPU utilization and reducing memory fragmentation.

kvcached is compatible with popular LLM serving engines, including SGLang and vLLM.

## kvcached Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python (tested with 3.11)
* PyTorch (tested with 2.6.0 and 2.7.0)

kvcached can be installed as simple as

```bash
pip install kvcached --no-build-isolation
```

Note that `--no-build-isolation` is required for kvcached to find the right PyTorch in the current virtual environment. If PyTorch is re-installed or upgraded, kvcached also needs re-installation.

kvcached now supports both **SGLang** and **vLLM**. While we are in the process of upstreaming the integration interfaces, we provide temporary support via code patches.

To apply a patch:

```bash
cd engine_integration/scripts
git apply [patch_name][engine_code_path]
```

## All-in-One Installation (Recommended for Development)

You can install everything (SGLang+vLLM+kvcached) by running the following commands:

```bash
cd engine_integration/scripts
./setup.sh all
```

This script will download the specified versions of SGLang and vLLM, create separate venv environments (using `uv`), compile the code, apply the necessary patches, and install kvcached.

## Testing

kvcached can be enabled or disabled by `export ENABLE_KVCACHED=true` or `false`. To verify the successful installation and benchmark the performance of SGLang/vLLM with kvcached, run:

```bash
cd engine_integration/benchmark
./start_server.sh [sgl|vllm]
# Wait until LLM server is ready
./start_client.sh [sgl|vllm]
```

The benchmark scripts automatically set `ENABLE_KVCACHED=true`. Please refer to each script for instructions on how to run SGLang/vLLM with kvcached.

## Memory monitoring and control via kvcached CLI

kvcached includes a built-in CLI tool that allows you to monitor GPU memory usage and manage memory limits across different applications. A command `kvctl` is installed along with kvcached package:

```bash
kvctl
```

Once inside the CLI, type `help` to view all supported commands:

```
kvcached> help
Available commands:
  list [ipc ...]               List IPC segments and usage
  limit <ipc> <size>           Set absolute limit (e.g. 512M, 2G)
  limit-percent <ipc> <pct>    Set limit as percentage of total GPU RAM
  watch [-n sec] [ipc ...]     Continuously display usage table
  kvtop [ipc ...] [--refresh r]  Launch curses kvtop UI (q to quit)
  !<shell cmd>                 Run command in system shell
  help                         Show this help message
  delete <ipc>                 Delete IPC segment and its limit entry
  exit | quit                  Exit the shell

kvcached>
```

Use the `kvtop` command for real-time visualization of memory usage:
