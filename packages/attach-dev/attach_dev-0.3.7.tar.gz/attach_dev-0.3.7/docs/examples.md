# Examples

## demo2.html (Planner â†” Coder UI)

Follow the steps in the HTML comment at the top of `demo2.html`
to start the gateway, both agents and the static web-page.

## Viewing memory

This example uses the **Docker-based** Weaviate server started by
`script/start_weaviate.py`, so no cloud signup is required.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python examples/demo_view_memory.py

```
