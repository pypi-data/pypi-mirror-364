For sending outgoing emails, users can change the config parameter
``mail_autogenerated_header.allow_autogenerated_outgoing`` to ``False`` to
avoid any outgoing emails being marked as autogenerated. For only avoiding
in certain cases, developers can set the context flag
``mail_autogenerated_header_disable`` in calls to ``send_email`` in order to
suppress adding any autogenerated headers.

For receiving incoming emails, developers can override the method
``_message_route_process_autoreply`` to fine tune dropping autogenerated mails
per model.
