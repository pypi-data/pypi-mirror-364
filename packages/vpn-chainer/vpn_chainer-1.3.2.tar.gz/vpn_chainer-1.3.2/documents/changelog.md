### Changed

### Fixed

- Changed hard-coded wg{i} interface naming to dynamic interface names derived from WireGuard config stems.

- **MAJOR ROUTING IMPROVEMENT**: Replaced device-only routing with gateway-aware routing for VPN chaining.
  - VPN ‚Üí VPN routing now uses `via <gateway_ip> dev <interface>` instead of just `dev <interface>`
  - Added proper endpoint routing for chained VPNs through immediate lower layer gateway to prevent routing loops
  - First VPN's endpoint is routed via host's original default gateway
  - Subsequent VPNs' endpoints are routed via their immediate lower layer VPN gateway
  
- Fixed VPN chaining routing issue where individual host addresses with CIDR notation were being used instead of proper network addresses for inter-VPN routing.
- Added error handling for existing route conflicts - now replaces conflicting routes instead of failing.
- Fixed shutdown cleanup to properly track and remove actual network routes instead of interface addresses.
- **MAJOR FIX**: Completely rewrote VPN chaining logic to properly route internet traffic through the VPN chain - traffic now flows correctly through VPN3 -> VPN2 -> VPN1 -> Internet.
- Added proper default route management using split routing (0.0.0.0/1 + 128.0.0.0/1) to override existing defaults.
- Implemented NAT (Network Address Translation) rules for proper traffic masquerading between VPN interfaces.
- Added IP forwarding configuration for each VPN interface and globally.
- Fixed DNS resolution through VPN chain by restarting DNS resolver after routing changes.
- **MAJOR REWRITE**: Replaced wg-quick usage with manual WireGuard interface creation to avoid routing conflicts.
- Fixed VPN chaining routing by implementing proper interface-to-interface routing instead of IP-based routing.
- Changed Flask server port from 5000 to 5001 to avoid common port conflicts.
