# PassEnv

Load environment variables from [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) entries seamlessly in your shell.

## Features

- **Secure**: Leverages the existing `pass` password manager
- **Simple**: Load/unload environment variables with a single command
- **Stateful**: Tracks what's loaded and prevents conflicts
- **Auto-completion**: Tab completion for pass entries
- **Shell Integration**: Works with bash and zsh

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) must be installed and initialized
- Python 3.8 or higher

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install passenv
```

### Set up shell integration

After installation, run the setup command:

```bash
passenv install
```

This will add the necessary shell function and completion to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or specific shell rc file.

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Load environment variables from a pass entry at database/envs
passenv load database/envs

# Check what's currently loaded
passenv status

# List available pass entries
passenv list

# Unload current environment
passenv unload
```

### Pass Entry Format

Store your environment variables in pass entries using the `KEY=VALUE` format:

```bash
# Create a pass entry
pass edit database/envs
```

Example entry content:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost/mydb
API_KEY=secret123
DEBUG=false
# This is a comment
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Environment Isolation

PassEnv automatically handles environment isolation:

- Loading a new set of environment variables automatically unloads the previous ones
- Tracks which variables were loaded to prevent conflicts
- Provides clear status information

## Examples

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Load development environment
passenv load myapp/development

# Run your application
python manage.py runserver

# Switch to staging environment
passenv load myapp/staging

# Deploy to staging
./deploy.sh

# Clean up
passenv unload
```

### Pass Entry Organization Suggestion

Organize your pass entries logically:

```
myapp/
├── development
├── staging
└── production

database/
├── local
├── staging
└── production
```

### Environment Variable Format

- **Comments**: Lines starting with `#` are ignored
- **Empty lines**: Skipped automatically
- **Format**: `KEY=VALUE` (spaces around `=` are stripped)
- **Quotes**: Optional quotes around values are removed
- **Variable names**: Must be valid shell variable names (`[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Pass not found**
```
Error: 'pass' command not found. Please install pass.
```
Install pass using your package manager:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install pass

# macOS
brew install pass

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S pass
```

**Pass not initialized**
```
Error: Pass store not initialized.
```
Initialize your pass store:
```bash
pass init your-gpg-key-id
```

**Entry not found**
```
Error: Pass entry 'myapp/staging' not found.
```
Create the entry:
```bash
pass edit myapp/staging
```

**Invalid variable format**
```
Error: Invalid line 'malformed-line' in pass entry.
```
Check your pass entry format. Each line should be `KEY=VALUE` or a comment.
