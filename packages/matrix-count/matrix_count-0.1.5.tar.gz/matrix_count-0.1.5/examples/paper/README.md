# Figure generation for the paper

Each folder in this directory contains the code to generate a figure for the paper.

`\symmetric_uniform`
- Figure showing the typical performance of the symmetric estimate on a random margin for the multigraph and simple graph cases. (2nd and 3rd order for the multigraph case)

`\real_degree_sequences`
- Figure with performance of the estimates on margins from real degree sequences.

`\symmetric_multigraph_test`

- Figure showing the typical performance of the symmetric estimate for
  generalized weighting.

- Figure showing the typical performance of the asymmetric estimate.
