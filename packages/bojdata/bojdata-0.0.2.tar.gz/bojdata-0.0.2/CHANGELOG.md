# Changelog

All notable changes to bojdata will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Test suite mocking for series validation in `test_read_multiple_series`, `test_date_filtering`, and related tests
- Progress indicator test to expect correct filename (`prices_m_en.zip` instead of `pr_m_en.csv.zip`)
- Import missing `SeriesNotFoundError` in test_core.py
- FRED to BOJ reverse mapping to prefer primary FRED codes (DEXJPUS over EXJPUS)
- Treasury/bond series suggestions in FRED compatibility (DGS10 now suggests FM08 for JGB yields)
- Retry logic AttributeError when response object is None in `exponential_backoff`
- Test mode data generation to be deterministic using seeded random state based on series and date range
