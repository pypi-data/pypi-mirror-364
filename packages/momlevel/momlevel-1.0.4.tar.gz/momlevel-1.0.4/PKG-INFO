# momlevel - Sea Level Routines for the Modular Ocean Model (MOM)
**momlevel** is a Python package in the public domain
that provides documentation and routines for analyzing sea level and
related quantities in MOM6-class models. The package initially focuses
on global and local steric sea level change in Boussinesq configurations.
