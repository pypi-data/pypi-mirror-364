# Introduction


`codeaudit` is a SAST tool to find **potential security issues** in Python source files.

Codeaudit is designed to be:
* Simple to use.
* Simple to extend for various use cases.
* Powerful to determine *potential* common security issues within Python code.



## Background

There are not many FOSS SAST tools for Python available that are simple. The most used and certainly a good one is `Bandit`. However this `Bandit` has some constrains that makes the use not simple and lacks crucial but needed validations.


:::{note}
This `codeaudit` tool is designed to be fast and simple and easy to maintain library that can be extended for future needs.
