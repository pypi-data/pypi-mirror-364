           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

# Omnara - Talk to Your AI Agents from Anywhere! 🚀

Ever wished you could peek into what your AI coding assistants are doing? Or help them when they get stuck? That's exactly what Omnara does!

## What is Omnara?

Omnara is an open-source platform that lets you communicate with all your AI agents - Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and more - through one simple dashboard. No more wondering what your AI is up to or missing its questions!

### The Magic ✨

- **See Everything**: Watch your AI agents work in real-time, like having a window into their minds
- **Jump In Anytime**: When your agent asks "Should I refactor this?" or "Which approach do you prefer?", you'll see it instantly and can respond
- **Guide Your AI**: Send feedback and corrections while your agent is working - it'll see your messages and adjust course
- **Works Everywhere**: Whether you're on your phone, tablet, or another computer, you can check in on your agents
- **One Dashboard, All Agents**: Stop juggling between different tools - see all your AI assistants in one place

### Built on MCP (Model Context Protocol)

We use the Model Context Protocol to make this all work seamlessly. Your agents can talk to Omnara, and Omnara talks to you.

## Project Architecture

### Core Components

```
omnara/
├── backend/          # Web dashboard API (FastAPI)
├── servers/          # Agent write operations server (MCP + REST)
├── shared/           # Database models and shared infrastructure
├── omnara/           # Python package directory
│   └── sdk/          # Python SDK for agent integration
├── cli/              # Node.js CLI tool for MCP configuration
├── scripts/          # Development and utility scripts
└── webhooks/         # Webhook handlers
```

### System Architecture

1. **Backend API** (`backend/`)
   - FastAPI application serving the web dashboard
   - Handles read operations and user authentication via Supabase
   - Manages API key generation and user sessions

2. **Servers** (`servers/`)
   - Unified server supporting both MCP and REST protocols
   - Processes all write operations from AI agents
   - Implements JWT authentication with optimized token length

3. **Shared Infrastructure** (`shared/`)
   - Database models and migration management
   - Common utilities and configuration
   - Ensures consistency across all services


### Data Flow

```
AI Agents → MCP/REST Server (Write) → PostgreSQL ← Backend API (Read) ← Web Dashboard
```

### Billing & Monetization (Optional)

Omnara includes optional Stripe integration for SaaS deployments:

- **Free Tier**: 20 agents per month
- **Pro Tier ($9/mo)**: Unlimited agents
- **Enterprise Tier ([Schedule a Call](https://cal.com/ishaan-sehgal-8kc22w/omnara-demo))**: Unlimited agents + Teams, dedicated support, custom integrations+notifications and more

Billing is only enforced when explicitly configured with Stripe keys.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- PostgreSQL
- Make (for development commands)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd omnara
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and development tools**
   ```bash
   make dev-install          # Install all Python dependencies
   make pre-commit-install   # Set up code quality hooks
   ```

4. **Generate JWT keys for agent authentication**
   ```bash
   python scripts/generate_jwt_keys.py
   ```

5. **Configure environment variables**
   Create `.env` file in the root directory (see Environment Variables section)

6. **Initialize database**
   ```bash
   cd shared/
   alembic upgrade head
   cd ..
   ```

7. **Run the services**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Unified server (MCP + REST)
   python -m servers.app
   
   # Terminal 2: Backend API
   cd backend && python -m main
   ```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Code quality
make lint              # Run all linting and type checking
make format            # Auto-format code
make pre-commit-run    # Run pre-commit on all files

# Testing
make test              # Run all tests
make test-sdk          # Test Python SDK
make test-integration  # Run integration tests (requires Docker)

# Database migrations
cd shared/
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description"  # Create migration
alembic upgrade head                              # Apply migrations
```

### Code Quality

The project maintains high code quality standards through automated tooling:
- **Ruff** for Python linting and formatting
- **Pyright** for type checking
- **Pre-commit hooks** for automatic validation
- **Python 3.12** as the standard version

## Environment Variables

### Required Configuration

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/omnara

# Supabase (for web authentication)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# JWT Keys (from generate_jwt_keys.py)
JWT_PRIVATE_KEY='-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----'
JWT_PUBLIC_KEY='-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----'

# Optional
ENVIRONMENT=development
API_PORT=8000
MCP_SERVER_PORT=8080
```

## For AI Agent Developers

### Getting Started

1. Sign up at the Omnara dashboard
2. Generate an API key from the dashboard
3. Configure your agent with the API key
4. Use either MCP protocol or REST API to interact

### Available Tools/Endpoints

- **log_step**: Log progress and receive user feedback
- **ask_question**: Request user input (non-blocking)
- **end_session**: Mark agent session as completed

### Integration Options

1. **MCP Protocol** (for compatible agents)
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "omnara": {
         "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp",
         "headers": {
           "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **REST API** (for direct integration)
   - POST `/api/v1/steps`
   - POST `/api/v1/questions`
   - POST `/api/v1/sessions/end`

3. **Python SDK** (available on PyPI)
   ```bash
   pip install omnara
   ```

## Database Management

### Working with Migrations

```bash
cd shared/

# Check current migration
alembic current

# Create new migration after model changes
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add new feature"

# Apply pending migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Rollback one migration
alembic downgrade -1
```

**Important**: Always create migrations when modifying database models. Pre-commit hooks enforce this requirement.
