This is the repository associated with the manuscript _Competitiveness analysis to identify marginal suppliers in consequential LCA: A seaweed case_. 

The repository is designed as a Python library to help users calculate Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) using BACI trade data.

## üìñ Background Knowledge 

### BACI Dataset
The [BACI](https://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele_item.asp?id=37) (from CEPII) dataset offers detailed information on bilateral trade flows for 200 countries, broken down by product (covering 5,000 products). The data spans various time periods, ranging from 2 to 28 years, depending on the specific dataset. Each year's data is stored in a separate `CSV` file. Each file contains six columns: _t = year_, _i = exporter_, _j = importer_, _k = product_, _v = value_, and _q = quantity_, and comprises over one million rows of data. 

This library can calculate RCA for both _quantity_ (metric tons) and _value_ (thousand USD).

### Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA)
In international economics, the RCA is a metric that evaluating the relative advantage or disadvantage of a certain country in a certain class of goods or services as evidenced by trade flows. It is based on the Ricardian comparative advantage concept. [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_comparative_advantage)  

### Formula
$RCA^i_j = \left( \frac{X^i_j}{X^i_n} \middle/ \frac{X^w_j}{X^w_n} \right)$ 
Where:
- $X^i_j$: Export value of commodity i from a country to country j.
- $X^i_n$: Total export value of commodity i from all exporting countries to country j.
- $X^w_j$: Total export value of all commodities from a country to country j.
- $X^w_n$: Total export value of all commodities from all exporting to country j.
- $RCA^i_j$: Comparative advantage of commodity i of a country in country j.
