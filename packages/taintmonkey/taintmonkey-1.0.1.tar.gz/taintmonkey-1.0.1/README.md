TaintMonkey is a a dynamic taint analysis library for Python Flask web applications. It leverages monkey patching to instrument Flask applications without modifying source code. TaintMonkey includes a built-in fuzzer that helps developers test endpoints for specific vulnerabilities with randomized inputs. This repository also comes with *JungleGym*, a datatset of 100+ example Flask applications susceptible to web vulnerabilities from the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE).

## Installation
To install the latest version of TaintMonkey, you can run the following command.

```
pip install taintmonkey
```

## Usage
In order to test a Flask endpoint for a particular vulnerability with TaintMonkey, you must first create a plugin.

### Step 1: Monkey Patch the Source
Monkey patch your endpoint's source to return a tainted string.

Example for OS Command Injection:
```python
@patch_function("dataset.cwe_78_os_command_injection.insecure_novalidation.app.open_file_command")
def new_open_file_command(file: TaintedStr):
    return TaintedStr(original_function(file))
```

### Step 2: Create `taintmonkey()` Fixture
Write a `taintmonkey()` fixture that passes your app's verifier, sanitizer, and sink functions to the `TaintMonkey` class. TaintMonkey automatically monkey patches these functions to add taint analysis instrumentation. Next, initialize and set a fuzzer (dictionary, mutation, or grammar-based) for TaintMonkey to use.

Example:
```python
VERIFIERS = []
SANITIZERS = []
SINKS = ["os.popen"]

@pytest.fixture()
def taintmonkey():
    from dataset.cwe_78_os_command_injection.insecure_novalidation.app import app

    tm = TaintMonkey(app, verifiers=VERIFIERS, sanitizers=SANITIZERS, sinks=SINKS)

    fuzzer = MutationBasedFuzzer(app, "plugins/cwe_78_os_command_injection/corpus.txt")
    tm.set_fuzzer(fuzzer)

    return tm
```

### Step 3: Write The Fuzzing Harness
The fuzzing harness is how a TaintMonkey plugin uses inputs generated by the fuzzer to test an endpoint for vulnerabilities. Use the fuzzer's context manager to get a `TaintClient` object and input generator. Then iterate through the generated inputs and make requests to the endpoint using those inputs.

Example:
```python
def test_fuzz(taintmonkey):
    fuzzer = taintmonkey.get_fuzzer()

    counter = 0
    print()
    with fuzzer.get_context() as (client, input_generator):
        for _, data in zip(range(10), input_generator):
            print(f"[Fuzz Attempt {counter}] {data}")

            client.get(f"/insecure?{urlencode({'file': data})}")
            counter += 1
```

### Step 4: Run Plugin
Run the plugin to test if your Flask endpoint is vulnerable.

Example:
```
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -s plugins/cwe_78_os_command_injection/__init__.py
```

During execution, a `TaintException` is raised if tainted input reaches a sink without proper verification or sanitization (assuming that verifiers, sanitizers, and sinks have been correctly registered with the `TaintMonkey` object).


## Development
To download the necessary packages for TaintMonkey, run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We use `ruff` to check the formatting of our code so before submitting a Pull Request, make sure to run the formatter using the following command.

```
python -m ruff format --no-cache
```

To run the unit test suite, use the following command.

```
PYTHONPATH=. pytest
```

To generate a coverage report of TaintMonkey, run the following commands.

```
PYTHONPATH=. pytest --cov=taintmonkey --cov-report html tests/
cd htmlcov/
python3 -m http.server
```

The HTML report generated by coverage-py should be available at http://localhost:8000.

## Experiments
In order to run experiments using the *JungleGym* dataset, make sure to set up the environment by doing the following.

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
bash experiments/setup.sh
```
