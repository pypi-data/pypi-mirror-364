# TaintMonkey
Dynamic taint analysis of Python web applications using monkey patching.

## Development
We use `ruff` to check the formatting of our code so before submitting a Pull Request, make sure to run the formatter using the following command.

```
python -m ruff format --no-cache
```

To run the unit test suite, use the following command.

```
PYTHONPATH=. pytest
```

To generate a coverage report of TaintMonkey, run the following commands.

```
PYTHONPATH=. pytest --cov=taintmonkey --cov-report html tests/
cd htmlcov/
python3 -m http.server
```

The HTML report generated by coverage-py should be available at http://localhost:8000.

To run a specific TaintMonkey plugin, run a command like this.
The following runs the CWE 78: OS Command Injection plugin as an example.

```
PYTHONPATH=. python3 plugins/cwe_78_os_command_injection/__init__.py
```

## Experiments
In order to run experiments using the *JungleGym* dataset, make sure to set up the environment by doing the following.

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
bash experiments/setup.sh
```
