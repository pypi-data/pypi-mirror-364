## Current Implementation

### retrieval/
Complete hybrid search implementation with BM25 lexical and semantic search.
- **hybrid_search.py**: Core search with 70/30 weighting and graph expansion
- **filters.py**: Weaviate filter generation with datetime parsing
- **cache.py**: LRU cache with TTL, batch operations support
- **rerank.py**: Multi-strategy re-ranking by type, recency, diversity
- **metrics.py**: Performance tracking via MetricsCollector composition
- **fuzzy_matcher.py**: Naming convention normalization

### compression/
Contextual compression without LLM dependencies.
- **chunk_compressor.py**: Heuristic compression with <50ms guarantee
- **strategies.py**: Document type specific strategies
- **contextual.py**: Query analysis with intent detection

### chunking/
Tree-sitter based intelligent code splitting with comprehensive metadata extraction.
- **base.py**: Tree-sitter integration with smart filtering
- **factory.py**: Automatic language detection
- **adaptive.py**: Dynamic parameter adjustment
- **languages/**: 31 language-specific chunkers:
  - 27 with full metadata implementation (code structure, patterns, security, quality)
  - 3 with partial metadata (DefaultChunker)
  - 1 abstract base class (ConfigBase)
  - 5 languages with comprehensive tests (Python, Java, XML, Default, Ruby)

### enrichment/
Git metadata extraction and graph updates.
- **service.py**: Main enrichment orchestration
- **processors/graph_builder.py**: Automatic neural graph updates

### graph/
Neural relationship tracking in SQLite.
- **neural_graph.py**: Graph persistence and queries
- **relations_manager.py**: Relationship detection and reinforcement  
- **pattern_detector.py**: Pattern discovery algorithms

### collections/
Weaviate schema management.
- **manager.py**: Collection lifecycle management
- **collection_names.py**: Enum preventing hardcoded strings
- **schemas.json**: 5 collection definitions

## Components Status

### Completed Components

### Components Needing Work

#### Testing Coverage (21/06/25)
- âœ… **Retrieval**: Excellent coverage (hybrid_search 91%, filters 95%, fuzzy_matcher 97%, rerank 97%, metrics 99%, cache 100%)
- âœ… **Compression**: Good coverage (contextual 90%, chunk_compressor 86%, strategies 55%)
- âœ… **Collections**: Excellent coverage (manager 99%, collection_names 100%)
- âœ… **Enrichment**: Good coverage (service 77%, graph_builder 96%)
- âœ… **Graph**: Good coverage (neural_graph 85%, pattern_detector 87%, relations_manager 84%)
- ðŸš§ **Chunking**: Mixed coverage
  - Base classes: base 72%, mixins 69%
  - Language chunkers: Most at 10-20% (only Python 95%, Java 91%, XML 84%, Default 94%, Ruby 100% have good coverage)

#### Integration Points
- âœ… IndexingService fully implemented in services/indexing_service.py
- âœ… HTTP endpoint `/api/index/git-changes` implemented for git hook integration
- âœ… All 5 Weaviate collections defined in schemas.json (including Task and DreamInsight)

#### Performance Optimization
- REVIEW: Batch size tuning for Weaviate operations
- REVIEW: Graph expansion depth limits

## Known Limitations

1. **Language Support**: 31 languages have chunkers (tree-sitter-languages supports ~30 common languages)
2. **Git Operations**: No auto-fetch, reactive only
3. **Graph Size**: No pruning strategy yet
4. **Cache**: Configurable size and TTL (defaults: 1000 entries, 3600s)

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Core: ID generation, exceptions, metrics
- Models: Chunk types, metadata schemas
- Embeddings: UniXcoder 768-dim vectors
- Services: IndexingService orchestration

### External Dependencies
- `tree-sitter-languages`: Pre-compiled parsers
- `GitPython`: Metadata extraction
- `weaviate-client`: Vector storage
- No ML frameworks or external APIs

## Performance Metrics (Estimates)

Typical performance on codebases:
- Chunking: ~80ms per file
- Search: ~150ms hybrid query
- Compression: ~30ms analysis
- Enrichment: ~100ms with git operations
