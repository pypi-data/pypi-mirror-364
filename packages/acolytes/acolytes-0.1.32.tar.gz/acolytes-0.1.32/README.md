### Installation

ACOLYTE can be installed as a Python package. For detailed installation instructions, see the **[📦 Installation Guide](INSTALL.md)**.

```bash
# Instala el paquete (nombre: 'acolytes')
pip install acolytes

# Usa el comando 'acolyte' (sin 's')
acolyte init
acolyte install
acolyte start
```

> ⏱️ **Nota**: La instalación y preparación descargan ~4-5GB (PyTorch, modelos, dependencias). Se recomienda tener al menos 10GB libres y una conexión estable. El proceso es idempotente y puede reanudarse si se interrumpe.

### Recuperación automática de instalación

Si la instalación se interrumpe (por error, corte de luz, etc.), simplemente ejecuta de nuevo:

```bash
acolyte install
```

El sistema detectará el estado anterior y continuará desde donde se quedó. Si hay problemas, puedes usar:

```bash
acolyte install --repair
```

para intentar reparar la instalación sin perder el progreso.

### Detección de primera vez y feedback inteligente

- ACOLYTE detecta si es la primera vez que se ejecuta en un proyecto y realiza todas las comprobaciones necesarias (modelos, colecciones, configuración).
- Si falta algo, te avisará y realizará la preparación completa automáticamente.
- Los mensajes de progreso y advertencia están adaptados a tu hardware y situación.

### Timeouts adaptativos

- Los tiempos de espera para descargas y health checks se ajustan automáticamente según tu hardware (RAM, CPU, tipo de disco).
- Si tu máquina es lenta o tiene poca RAM, los timeouts serán más generosos para evitar falsos errores.

```

## 🚀 Weaviate Schema Architecture

### Technical Excellence Assessment

ACOLYTE's vector database schema represents a **research-grade architecture** that surpasses most commercial code assistants in granularity and capability.

### 📊 Schema Overview

The system uses 5 specialized collections:

1. **CodeChunk** - Code fragments with 18 distinct types (FUNCTION, METHOD, CLASS, etc.)
2. **Conversation** - Indexed chat sessions with semantic relationships
3. **Document** - Complete documents (README, docs, configs)
4. **DreamInsight** - AI-discovered patterns and optimizations
5. **Task** - High-level task grouping and tracking

### 🎯 Clarity: 10/10

- **Crystal clear separation** of concepts (code vs conversations vs documents)
- **Descriptive naming** throughout - no magic strings or ambiguous fields
- **Well-defined enumerations** for all types (18 chunk types, 6 task types, etc.)
- **Self-documenting structure** - purpose is evident from schema alone

### 🛡️ Robustness: 9/10

**Strengths:**

- **HNSW + BM25** hybrid search - best of vector and keyword search
- **Git metadata as nested objects** - properly structured, not flattened
- **Field-specific tokenization** - whitespace for IDs, word for content
- **Production-ready sharding** - configured for horizontal scaling
- **Proper date fields** for temporal queries

**Design Decision:**

- `vectorizer: "none"` - Vectors generated by UniXcoder externally
- This is intentional: **"UniXcoder or nothing"** - no compromise on quality

### 🚀 Power: 9.5/10

**Unique Capabilities:**

- **18 granular chunk types** - more specific than GitHub Copilot
- **Automatic insight tracking** - patterns, connections, optimizations
- **Cross-collection relationships** - link conversations ↔ code ↔ tasks
- **Rich Git integration** - author, commit, message per chunk
- **Temporal search** - "What changed last week?"

**Killer Queries This Enables:**

- "Show all functions modified by [author] related to [bug]"
- "Find conversations that discussed this architectural pattern"
- "What code was written during debugging session X?"
- "Identify recurring optimization opportunities across the codebase"

## 🧠 Intelligent Code INDEXING Architecture

### Next-Generation Code Understanding

ACOLYTE's indexing system represents a **quantum leap in code comprehension** - not just parsing text, but truly understanding your code's structure, purpose, and relationships.

### 🎯 18 Distinct Code Types

Unlike traditional indexers that treat all code as text, ACOLYTE recognizes **18 specialized chunk types**:

- **Structural**: NAMESPACE, INTERFACE, CLASS
- **Executable**: CONSTRUCTOR, FUNCTION, METHOD, PROPERTY
- **Components**: IMPORTS, MODULE, CONSTANTS, TYPES
- **Quality**: TESTS, README, DOCSTRING, COMMENT
- **Meta**: SUMMARY, UNKNOWN

This granularity enables queries like:

- "Show all methods that handle authentication"
- "Find interfaces modified in the last sprint"
- "What functions are affected by this constant change?"

### 🔥 The Indexing Pipeline

```
1. ADAPTIVE CHUNKING → Smart code splitting with AST awareness
2. GIT ENRICHMENT → Who, when, why for every chunk
3. BATCH EMBEDDINGS → Vector representations for semantic search
4. NEURAL STORAGE → Weaviate graph with relationships
```

### 💎 What Makes It Revolutionary

**Git-Aware Context**: Every chunk knows:

- Last author and modification time
- Stability score (how often it changes)
- Related commits and messages
- Pattern metadata (is_test, has_todo, complexity)

**Semantic Understanding**: When you search for "payment processing", ACOLYTE finds:

- Functions named differently but semantically related
- Code that processes financial data
- Tests covering payment scenarios
- Documentation about billing

**Performance at Scale**:

- Parallel processing with 2-4x speedup on large codebases
- Batch operations reducing indexing time by 80%
- Smart caching preventing redundant work
- Handles 100k+ file projects effortlessly

### 🏆 Real-World Impact

This isn't just technical excellence - it transforms how you work:

- **"How does authentication work?"** → ACOLYTE shows the complete flow across files
- **"What changed in the last refactor?"** → Git-enriched chunks reveal the story
- **"Find security vulnerabilities"** → Type-aware search finds actual issues, not false positives
- **"Show me similar implementations"** → Vector search finds conceptually related code

**Bottom line**: ACOLYTE doesn't just index your code - it builds a living, breathing neural map of your entire project that understands code the way developers do.

_\* Context Window is irrelevant for ACOLYTE due to persistent memory - when a conversation window ends, the next session continues with a complete summary, creating effectively **♾️ INFINITE CONTEXT**._

### 🎯 Key Differentiators

**ACOLYTE's Unique Advantages:**

- **18 specialized code types** (vs competitors' basic chunking)
- **Persistent conversation memory** across sessions
- **100% local & private** by default
- **Git-enriched understanding** with commit context
- **Dream analysis system** for autonomous pattern detection
- **Zero-cost deployment** and usage

**Competitor Strengths:**

- **Cursor/Windsurf**: Multi-modal input, agent workflows
- **GitHub Copilot**: Tight GitHub integration, PR reviews
- **Sourcegraph Cody**: Enterprise-grade scalability
- **Claude Code**: Terminal-native with 200K context
- **Probe AI**: Local AST-based search without indexing

### 🏆 Verdict

This schema is **enterprise/research-grade**, not a toy project. The combination of:

- Fine-grained code understanding
- Persistent conversation context
- Automatic pattern detection
- Cross-domain linking

...creates a system that's **years ahead** of most local AI coding assistants.

**Philosophy**: No fallbacks, no compromises. When using the best embeddings model for code (UniXcoder), why accept anything less? If it fails, fix it and continue - don't degrade to inferior alternatives.

This is **pure technical integrity** - the schema of a system designed to be the best, not just "good enough".

## 🌙 Dream Analysis System Architecture

### Revolutionary Deep Analysis Engine

ACOLYTE's Dream system represents a **breakthrough in autonomous code analysis** - like having ChatGPT's "Deep Search" or Claude's "Deep Research" but specifically for YOUR codebase.

### 💡 Core Concept

While you work, ACOLYTE accumulates "fatigue" - a sophisticated metric based on:

- Code churn and instability (30%)
- Recent commit activity (30%)
- Code volatility index (20%)
- Architectural changes (10%)
- Time since optimization (10%)

When fatigue is high AND you ask a complex question, ACOLYTE can suggest: "_May I take 5 minutes for a Deep Search-style analysis?_"

### 🎯 Clarity: 10/10

- **Crystal clear states**: MONITORING → DROWSY → DREAMING → REM → DEEP_SLEEP → WAKING
- **GitMetadata-driven**: Every calculation based on real metrics, not magic numbers
- **Explicit permission model**: NEVER activates without user consent
- **Transparent process**: User sees exactly what's happening during analysis

### 🛡️ Robustness: 9.5/10

**Strengths:**

- **Dual-mode operation**: Full mode with Weaviate, degraded mode without
- **Thread-safe state management**: Asyncio locks prevent race conditions
- **Batch-optimized queries**: From N+1 problems to single batch calls
- **Configurable everything**: Window sizes, durations, thresholds, priorities
- **Error resilience**: Each component fails gracefully with sensible defaults

**Design Philosophy:**

- **"Always ask permission"** - No autonomous actions ever
- **"Real value over theater"** - Actual insights, not simulated activity
- **"5 minutes max"** - Respects user time

### 🚀 Power: 10/10

**Unique Capabilities:**

- **5 specialized analysis types**: Bugs, Security, Performance, Architecture, Patterns
- **Context-aware windowing**: 32k models use sliding window, 128k+ single-pass
- **Git-integrated triggers**: Detects merge conflicts, rapid changes, instability
- **Persistent insights**: Database + markdown documentation
- **Cross-session learning**: Insights available to future conversations

**Analysis Types with Custom Prompts:**

```
bug_detection.md       → Find bugs, edge cases, error handling
security_analysis.md   → Vulnerabilities, input validation, auth issues
performance_analysis.md → N+1 queries, bottlenecks, optimization
architecture_analysis.md → Design flaws, coupling, tech debt
pattern_detection.md   → Anti-patterns, repeated code, improvements
```

### 🎭 Example Scenarios

**Security Analysis Request:**

```
User: "Review the authentication system for vulnerabilities"
ACOLYTE: "To perform a complete security analysis I need to enter
         DeepDream mode. May I take 5 minutes to investigate thoroughly?"
User: "Yes"
[5 minutes of REM-level analysis]
ACOLYTE: "Found 3 critical issues. Details saved to:
         .acolyte-dreams/2024-01-15_security_analysis.md"
```

**High Fatigue Suggestion:**

```
User: "Why is the API so slow lately?"
ACOLYTE: "I've noticed significant code activity (fatigue: 8.5/10).
         To properly investigate the performance issues, I should
         perform a deep analysis. May I take 5 minutes?"
User: "Go ahead"
[Deep performance analysis across entire codebase]
ACOLYTE: "Found the issue: N+1 queries in 3 services. Here's how to fix it..."
```

### 🤯 The Context Window Advantage

**The genius of Dream**: Instead of fighting context window limitations, Dream **exploits them as a feature**:

- **Multiple thinking sessions**: Uses 1, 2, or more context windows to reorganize understanding
- **Fresh perspective each cycle**: Each window analyzes from different angles without pollution
- **Progressive refinement**: Early cycles identify patterns, later cycles deep-dive into specifics
- **No context contamination**: Each phase starts with optimized, relevant context
- **Intelligent chunking**: For 32k models, processes ~28k tokens of new code per cycle while preserving critical findings

It's literally giving the AI the ability to "sleep on the problem" - what can't be understood in one constrained window can be progressively understood across multiple focused analysis sessions.

This is why Dream can find issues that single-pass analysis misses - it's not limited by what fits in one context window.

### 📝 Analysis Reports

Dream generates comprehensive markdown reports saved to `.acolyte-dreams/`:

```
.acolyte-dreams/
├── 2024-01-15_security_analysis.md
├── 2024-01-16_performance_insights.md
└── summaries/
    └── latest.json
```

Each report includes:

- Executive summary with critical findings
- Detailed analysis by category (bugs, security, performance)
- Code references with file:line citations
- Actionable recommendations
- Confidence scores for each finding

### 🔄 Dual-Mode Operation

Dream operates in two modes for maximum resilience:

- **FULL MODE** (with Weaviate): Complete search capabilities, finds recently changed files, tracks activity patterns
- **DEGRADED MODE** (without Weaviate): Limited but functional, analyzes default project files, returns conservative fatigue estimates

This ensures Dream works even if some services are unavailable, though with reduced capabilities.

### 🧠 Neural Graph Integration

**The hidden power of Dream**: It leverages ACOLYTE's Neural Graph - a living map of your codebase that tracks:

- **Structural relationships**: Who imports whom, who calls whom, who extends whom
- **Co-modification patterns**: Files that change together, detected through Git history
- **Connection strength**: Relationships strengthen with use, like neural synapses (0.0-1.0)
- **Impact prediction**: "If I change login.py, what breaks?" → Instant dependency analysis

When you request a Dream analysis, it doesn't just search files - it traverses the neural graph to understand the deep connections in your code.

### 🎯 User-Directed Deep Analysis

**You can force a Dream session** when your intuition tells you something's wrong:

```
User: "I think there's something wrong with the payment module.
       Can you take a deep dive and investigate?"
ACOLYTE: "I'll perform a focused Dream analysis on the payment system.
         May I take 5 minutes to trace all connections and patterns?"
User: "Go ahead"
[Uses neural graph to map ALL payment dependencies]
ACOLYTE: "Found the issue: The payment module has a circular dependency
         with the notification system causing intermittent failures..."
```

This turns ACOLYTE from a reactive assistant into a **proactive investigator** that follows your hunches.

For complete CLI documentation, see **[📖 CLI Reference](bin/README.md)**.

## 🔧 Configuration

ACOLYTE stores configuration in `~/.acolyte/projects/{id}/config.yaml`:

```yaml
model:
  name: "qwen2.5-coder:3b" # 0.5b, 1.5b, 3b, 7b, 14b, 32b
  context_size: 32768

ports: # Auto-assigned to avoid conflicts
  weaviate: 42080 # Vector database
  ollama: 42434 # LLM server
  backend: 42000 # ACOLYTE API

dream:
  fatigue_threshold: 7.5 # When to suggest rest
  cycle_duration_minutes: 5
```

> **🔄 Multi-Project Support**: ACOLYTE automatically assigns different ports for each project. See [Multi-Project Ports](docs/MULTI_PROJECT_PORTS.md) for details.

## ⚡ Parallel Indexing (v0.1.8+)

ACOLYTE now supports **parallel indexing** for faster processing of large projects:

```yaml
# Enable in your .acolyte configuration
indexing:
  enable_parallel: true # Activate parallel processing
  concurrent_workers: 4 # Number of workers (based on CPU cores)
```

- **2-4x faster** indexing for projects with >100 files
- Automatic activation when `enable_parallel: true` and >20 files
- Each worker has its own Weaviate client (thread-safe)
- GPU operations limited by semaphore to prevent OOM

For detailed configuration, see [Parallel Indexing Guide](PARALLEL_INDEXING_GUIDE.md).

## 🔌 API Endpoints

ACOLYTE provides an OpenAI-compatible API:

- `POST /v1/chat/completions` - Chat with ACOLYTE
- `POST /v1/embeddings` - Generate embeddings
- `GET /v1/models` - List available models
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `WS /api/ws/chat` - WebSocket chat

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

Here are quick solutions to common issues:

### "acolyte: command not found"

```bash
# Linux/Mac
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Windows - Add Python Scripts to PATH
```

### "pip install acolyte" falla

> El nombre correcto del paquete es `acolytes` (con 's'). Usa:
>
