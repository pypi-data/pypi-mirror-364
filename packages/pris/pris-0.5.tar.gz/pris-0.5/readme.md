# PRIS - pattern recognition integer sequence.

> A tool for detecting patterns and overlaps in data streams using parallel realtime stream sequence detection with a finite automoton.

PRIS is designed to detect patterns or sequences in data streams. Capture character strings or event sequences without caching, states, or overhead. Ideal for game input detection and sequence testing.

---

PRIM aims to simplify the _silently complex_ task of finding sequences in streams, such as typed characters or object event detection, without storing cached assets.

Currently built into this Python library, PRIM is designed to identify and match sequences within data streams, specializing in detecting patterns, overlaps, and recurring elements in various types of data, such as character strings or event sequences.

The library operates in _real-time_, making it a versatile tool for applications like game 'cheat' input detection, sequence testing, and more.


+ Feedforward sequencing
+ Works with stream data
+ Detect overlapping and repeat sequences
+ functional sinking for inline dynamic _paths_
+ Minimal overhead (1 integer per path)
+ Unlimited path length

## What is it.

> Parallel Sequence Detection on Realtime Streams with a Finite Automoton

Or by definition: A [pattern recongition integer] sequence - table.

+ **Parallel**: Detect many sequences in parallel, such as detecting "wind" in "window" and "sidewinder"
+ **Sequence**: Maintain sequences, such as `W -> I -> N -> D`
+ **Detection**: Discover these sequences within streams of data, such as a file
+ **Realtime** Streams: Any stream of data, such as live media or sockets (unseekable records)
+ **a Finite Automoton**: the micro internal machinery of the algorithm, detecting sequences, and keeping indicies.


## How does it work

1. Add sequences to detect (such as string)
2. Input event streams (such as keyboard key presses)
3. Capture events for sequence matches

Internally the _current state_ of detections is a table of integers.

## Efficiencies

1. O(k) sequence initiation using _hot start_
2. One signed integer per path
3. O(k) position testing - one test per _bit_ per path

Notably O(n) for iterating table live sequences (Any sequence with an index greater than `-1`)

## Usage

To use the `python-pris` library, start by importing the library and initializing the Sequences object. Define your sequences and input them into the object. Here's a basic example:

```py
from pris.sequences import Sequences

# Define a sequence
sequence = ('a', 'b', 'c')
sequence_key = "abc"

# Initialize the Sequences object and input the sequence
sq = Sequences()
sq.input_sequence(sequence, 'optional-key')
```

Then execute detections:

```py
hots, matches, drops = sq.table_insert_keys(['a','b', 'c'])
```

### Possible Usages:

+ Game key input strings (combos etc..)
+ Parallel bit sequencing for streams
    + Capturing tiny strings in big files
    + readling pipe data during transit for sequences
+ Ordered structure testing, such as "commands" from a socket
    + such as oauth process matching

## Example

As an example, we define the Konami Code sequence and input it into the `Sequences` object. We then simulate button presses and check for sequence matches. The Konami Code is successfully matched when the entire sequence of buttons is pressed.


```py
from pris.sequences import Sequences

# Define the Konami Code sequence
KONAMI_CODE = ('up', 'up', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'b', 'a', 'start')
CODE_NAME = 'konami'

# Initialize the Sequences object
sq = Sequences()

# Input the Konami Code sequence into the Sequences object
sq.input_sequence(KONAMI_CODE, CODE_NAME)

# Simulate button presses and check for matches
## Using `table_insert_keys` rather than `insert_keys` for demo printing.
button_sequence = KONAMI_CODE[:-1]  # Simulate pressing all buttons except the last one
hots, matches, drops = sq.table_insert_keys(button_sequence)

# At this point, no complete matches are found
print("Complete", matches)  # Output: Complete ()

# Press the last button in the sequence
hots, matches, drops = sq.table_insert_keys(['start'])

# Now, the Konami Code sequence is successfully matched
print("Complete", matches)  # Output: Complete ('konami',)
```


## Functional Positions

> Apply functions as keys within a sequence. If the _sink_ function return `True`, the sequence will continue matching, If `False` the sequence is dropped.

With `Sequences` you can define a single sequence with functional positions. A functional position in a sequence is a position where a function is expected rather than a specific value. This function will be called with the actual value at that position, and the sequence will continue if the function returns `True`.

```py
from pris.sequences import Sequences

def sink(v):
    return True

sequence_with_sink = ('a', sink, 'c') # Will match a => ? => c
sq = Sequences()
sq.input_sequence(sequence_with_sink)

hots, matches, drops = sq.table_insert_keys(['a', 'b', 'c'])

print("Matches", matches)  # Output: Matches ('a?c',)
```

For a more grounded example, here we detect if the second character is a vowel:

```py
from pris.sequences import Sequences

# Define a function to check if a character is a vowel
def vowel(v):
    return v in 'aeiou'

# Define a sequence with a functional position and a key "p?t"
sequence_with_function = ('p', vowel, 't')
sequence_key = "p?t"

# Initialize the Sequences object and input the sequence
sq = Sequences()
sq.input_sequence(sequence_with_function, sequence_key)

# Simulate multiple inputs and check for matches
inputs = [
    ['p', 'a', 't'],  # This input matches the sequence
    ['p', 'u', 't'],  # This input also matches the sequence
    ['p', 'e', 't'],  # This input matches as well
]

for input_values in inputs:
    hots, matches, drops = sq.table_insert_keys(input_values)
    print(f"Input: {''.join(input_values)}")
    print("Matches", matches)  # Output: Matches ('p?t',)
    print("-----")
```

In this example we simulate three different inputs: "pat", "put", and "pet". All three inputs match the sequence as they all have a vowel in the middle position.


## Key ID

A `key` for the applied sequence may be any value. If `None` The _key_ is a string of the given value

```py
import pris.sequences as sequences


WORDS = (
    ('w', 'i', 'n', 'd', 'o', 'w',),
    'windy',
    )


sq = sequences.Sequences(WORDS)
trip = sq.insert_keys(*'window')
```

We see the _window_ tuple, literally prints as a stringyfied tuple:

```py
(
    ("('w', 'i', 'n', 'd', 'o', 'w')", 'windy'),  # Activated
    ("('w', 'i', 'n', 'd', 'o', 'w')",),          # Matches
    ('windy',)                                    # Drops
)
```

Inserting `"window"` with a key, changes the output:

```py
import pris.sequences as sequences


WORDS = (
    'windy',
    )
sq = sequences.Sequences(WORDS)
sq.input_sequence(('w', 'i', 'n', 'd', 'o', 'w',), 'window')

trip = sq.insert_keys(*'window')
(
    ('window', 'windy'),   # Activated
    ('window'),            # Matches
    ('windy')              # Drops
)
```

Or we can define it on the initial input as a dictionary:

```py
import pris.sequences as sequences


WORDS = {
    'window': ('w', 'i', 'n', 'd', 'o', 'w',),
    'windy' :'windy',
}


sq = sequences.Sequences(WORDS)
trip = sq.insert_keys(*'window')
```

Alternatively we can use the `Sequence` class


```py
import pris.sequences as sequences


WORDS = (
    Sequence('window', 'w', 'i', 'n', 'd', 'o', 'w'),
    Sequence(name='window', path=('w', 'i', 'n', 'd', 'o', 'w')),
    Sequence('window', Path('w', 'i', 'n', 'd', 'o', 'w')),
    Sequence('windy'),
    Sequence(path='windy'),
)


sq = sequences.Sequences(WORDS)
trip = sq.insert_keys(*'window')
```


## More Example

```py
import pris.sequences as sequences

def sink(v):
    # Any value given is acceptable.
    return True


def vowel(v):
    return v in 'aieou'


WORDS = (
    ('w', 'i', 'n', 'd', 'o', 'w',),
    'windy',
    ('q', sink, 'd'),
    ('c', vowel, 't',),
    )


sq = sequences.Sequences(WORDS)
trip = sq.insert_keys(*'window')

```

---

A very long string:

    supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

containing your sequence `fragil`, and `a?i`, where `?` is any character:

```py
from pris.sequences import Sequences
from collections import Counter

# Define a sink function that always returns True
def sink(v):
    return True

# Initialize the Sequences object
sq = Sequences()

# Define and input the sequences
sq.input_sequence('fragil')
sq.input_sequence(('a', sink, 'i'), 'a?i')
```

Now, we can simulate the input of the characters from the incoming string and use `collections.Counter` to count the instances of each detected sequence:

```py
# Initialize a Counter object to count the instances
sequence_counter = Counter()

# Simulate the input of characters and count the sequences
incoming_string = "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"

for char in incoming_string:
    _, matches, _ = sq.insert_key(char)
    sequence_counter.update(matches)

# Print the count of each detected sequence
print(sequence_counter)
Counter({'a?i': 3, 'fragil': 1})

```

You could cheat and run all keys without the loop, gathering the results as they occur:

```py
did_hot, did_match, did_drop = sq.insert_keys(*incoming_string)
# ('fragil', 'a?i'), ('fragil', 'a?i'), ('fragil', 'a?i')
```

We see when running the entire incoming string, it maintains all changes for a key ocross the three states. A successful key will hit all three positions (hot, match, drop).

For example we have a list of words and input `window`

    ?: window
    # ... 5 more frames.

    WORD    POS  | NEXT | STRT | OPEN | HIT  | DROP
    apples       |      |      |      |      |
    window   1   |  i   |      |  #   |  #   |
    ape          |      |      |      |      |
    apex         |      |      |      |      |
    extra        |      |      |      |      |
    tracks       |      |      |      |      |
    stack        |      |      |      |      |
    yes          |      |      |      |      |
    cape         |      |      |      |      |
    cake         |      |      |      |      |
    echo         |      |      |      |      |
    win      1   |  i   |  #   |  #   |      |
    wind     1   |  i   |  #   |  #   |      |
    windy    1   |  i   |  #   |  #   |      |
    w        1   |      |  #   |  #   |  #   |
    ww       1   |  w   |  #   |  #   |      |
    ddddd        |      |      |      |      |

The library can detect overlaps and repeat letters. Therefore when _ending_ a sequence, you can _start_ another. For example the word `window` can also be a potential start of another `w...` sequence - such as the single char `w`.


reducing complexity from `O(n)` to `o(k)` through hot reduction.


# Algorithm Understanding


The algorithm was initially developed for securing WebSocket channels, allowing users to switch channels securely on the server side while tracking their movements. Each transaction marked a position along a path, defining what the user was allowed to subscribe to. This robust solution evolved to detect sequences of inputs, such as keys, where each key could be a character, object, or event. This approach is particularly useful for handling long input sequences without storing a historical cache, thereby maintaining efficiency.

## Functionality

1. **Hot Key Detection**
   - When an input key sequence is applied, the algorithm first tests for hot keys.
   - If a key is hot, it activates or tracks that path or sequence.

2. **Sequence Insertion**
   - The algorithm checks if the key is part of the hot start.
   - If the key is part of the hot start, the sequence key map reference is loaded and marked as active.

3. **Index Initialization**
   - Every position in the sequence table is initialized to minus one.
   - The HOTSTART function sets the key to zero if it should start the sequence, enabling the path.

4. **Table Testing**
   - The algorithm maintains a table of all sequences with an integer indicating the current position.
   - If a sequence is active, the current input is tested against the expected value at the sequence's current position.

5. **Testing and Assertion**
   - If the input matches the expected value, the position index is incremented.
   - If the input does not match, the index resets to minus one.

6. **Iterative Processing**
   - The process repeats for each input.
   - If a sequence completes successfully, it registers a hit.
   - Otherwise, the sequence either continues or drops.

## Path Handling

- **Non-Interference**: Paths cannot interfere with themselves. Multiple characters in a sequence do not conflict, ensuring smooth processing.
- **Parallel Paths**: Different sequences with similar initial inputs can coexist without interference. For example, "windy" and "wind" can be processed in parallel without conflict.


## Understanding Hots, Matches, and Drops

When using the Sequences library, three key concepts are essential: hots (hot starts), matches, and drops. Here’s a brief overview and a demonstration of each:

+ **Hots**: Represent sequences that have started matching and are actively being tracked.
+ **Matches**: Denote sequences that have been successfully matched.
+ **Drops**: Indicate sequences that were being tracked but have been dropped due to a mismatch.

```py
from pris.sequences import Sequences

# Define sequences
SEQUENCE_A = ('a', 'b', 'c')
SEQUENCE_B = ('x', 'y', 'z')

# Initialize the Sequences object
sq = Sequences()

# Input sequences into the Sequences object
sq.input_sequence(SEQUENCE_A, 'Sequence A')
sq.input_sequence(SEQUENCE_B, 'Sequence B')

# Simulate partial input and check the state
hots, matches, drops = sq.table_insert_keys(['a', 'b'])
print("Hots", hots)  # Output: Hots ('Sequence A',)
print("Matches", matches)  # Output: Matches ()
print("Drops", drops)  # Output: Drops ()

# Simulate a mismatch
hots, matches, drops = sq.table_insert_keys(['x'])
print("Hots", hots)  # Output: Hots ('Sequence B',)
print("Matches", matches)  # Output: Matches ()
print("Drops", drops)  # Output: Drops ('Sequence A',)

# Complete the matching for Sequence B
hots, matches, drops = sq.table_insert_keys(['y', 'z'])
print("Hots", hots)  # Output: Hots ()
print("Matches", matches)  # Output: Matches ('Sequence B',)
print("Drops", drops)  # Output: Drops ()
```

### Matches

In the context of the Sequences class, a "match" refers to a successful identification of a sequence within the provided iterable. When you insert a key (or character) into the sequence, the library checks if this key aligns with any of the predefined sequences. If it does, and the sequence is completed, it's considered a "match". For instance, if you've defined the sequence "win" and you sequentially insert the keys "w", "i", and "n", you'll get a match for the sequence "win".

### Misses (Drops)

The term "drops" is synonymous with "misses". A "miss" or "drop" occurs when a key is inserted that doesn't align with the next expected key in any of the active sequences. This means that the current path being traced doesn't match any of the predefined sequences. When this happens, the sequence's position is reset (if reset_on_fail is set to True), effectively dropping or missing the sequence.

For example, if you've defined the sequence "win" and you insert the keys "w" and "a", the sequence is dropped or missed because "a" doesn't follow "w" in the predefined sequence.

### Hots (Hot Starts)

The concept of "hots" or "hot starts" is a performance optimization in the Sequences class. Instead of checking every possible sequence every time a key is inserted, the library maintains a "hot start" list for sequences that are currently active or have a high likelihood of matching. This list contains the starting characters of all predefined sequences. When a key is inserted that matches one of these starting characters, the sequence is considered "hot" and is actively checked for matches as subsequent keys are inserted.

For instance, if you've defined sequences "win" and "wind", and you insert the key "w", both sequences become "hot" and are actively checked for matches as you continue to insert keys.
