    # Comments on numpy build requirement range:
    #
    #   1. >=2.0.x is the numpy requirement for wheel builds for distribution
    #      on PyPI - building against 2.x yields wheels that are also
    #      ABI-compatible with numpy 1.x at runtime.
    #   2. Note that building against numpy 1.x works fine too - users and
    #      redistributors can do this by installing the numpy version they like
    #      and disabling build isolation.
    #   3. The <2.3 upper bound due to removal of the deprecated v1.7 API used by our Boost extension.
