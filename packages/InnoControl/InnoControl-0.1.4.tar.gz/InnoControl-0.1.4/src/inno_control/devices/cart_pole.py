class CartPole(LabDevice):
    """
    Interface for controlling and reading from a physical Cart-Pole system via an ESP32 device.

    This class allows you to initialize, start, stop, and control a real inverted pendulum on a cart.
    It communicates via serial port, sending commands to the onboard controller which drives the cart motor
    to balance the pendulum upright by applying horizontal forces.

    The Cart-Pole is a classic non-linear control benchmark: the goal is to keep the pendulum in unstable equilibrium
    by continuously adjusting the cart position.

    Attributes:
        _state (str): Current state of the system, can be 'UNKNOWN', 'READY', or 'STARTED'.
