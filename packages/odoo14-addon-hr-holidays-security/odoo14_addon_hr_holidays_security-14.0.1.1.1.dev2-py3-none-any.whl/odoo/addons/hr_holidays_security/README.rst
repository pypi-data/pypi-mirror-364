This module extends the permissions of Time Off responsibles and
approvers to flex their team assignments. Users with the permissions of
Time Off responsibles can now view the Reporting menu.

Use Cases / Context
===================

In a large organization Time Off Responsible users powers can be so
rigid, as they aren't allowed to fully approve their team's requests.
Time Off All Approvers have a too much approval scope while Time Off
Manager would be too powerful.

This module aims to adjust those powers for each group, respecting the
core workflow.

Usage
=====

Now a Time Off Responsible and All Approvals users can view, creat,
edit, reject, set as draft leaves and allocation from their team
employees.

Now a Time Off Responsible can view the Reporting menu (by Employee and
by Type) and will be able to view only the appropriate records.
