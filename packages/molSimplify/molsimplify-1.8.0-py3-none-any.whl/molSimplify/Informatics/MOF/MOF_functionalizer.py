    Adds functional group atoms that are not the connecting atom.
    Adds these atoms to the connecting atom.

    Parameters
    ----------
    connection_atom_dict : dict
        For each functional group, indicates the element in the functional group that connects to the carbon atom; then indicates remaining elements for multiatomic functional groups.
    bond_length_dict : dict
        For each functional group (as applicable), indicates the bond length of the connecting atom on the functional group to the other atoms in the functional group, in angstroms.
    bond_angle_dict : dict
        For each functional group (as applicable), indicates how far off a straight line the non-connecting functional group atoms are,
        relative to a directional unit vector that goes through the connecting carbon and the connecting atom on the functional group.
        For example, for CF3, this is the C-C-F angle, where the first C is the carbon being functionalized and the second C is part of the CF3 functional group.
    bond_rotation_dict : dict
        For each functional group (as applicable), indicates the angle rotation and the number of rotations for non-connecting atoms. E.g. for CH3, the hydrogens are 120 degrees rotated apart.

        Shape is (3,).
