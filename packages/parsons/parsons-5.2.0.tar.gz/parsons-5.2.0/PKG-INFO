A Python package that provides a simple interface to a variety of utilities and tools frequently used by progressive
organizations, political and issue campaigns, activists, and other allied actors.

Parsons offers simplified interactions with these services and tools, including a growing number of CRMs, organizing
tools, cloud compute service providers, as well as tools to easily transform data in transit.

This project is maintained by [The Movement Cooperative](https://movementcooperative.org/) and is named
after [Lucy Parsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Parsons). The Movement Cooperative is a member-led organization
focused on providing data, tools, and strategic support for the progressive community.

Parsons is only supported for Python 3.9-13.

## License and Usage

Usage of Parsons is governed by
a [modified Apache License with author attribution statement](https://github.com/move-coop/parsons/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

## Documentation

To gain a full understanding of all of the features of Parsons, please review the
Parsons [documentation](https://move-coop.github.io/parsons/html/index.html).

## Installation

### PYPI

You can install the most recent release by running: `pip install parsons[all]`

### Install from Github

To access the most recent code base that may contain features not yet included in the latest release, download this
repository and then run `python -m pip install git+https://github.com/move-coop/parsons.git`.

### Docker Container

We have a Parsons Docker container hosted on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/movementcooperative/parsons) for each
release of Parsons, including the `latest`.

## Quickstart

For this Quickstart, we are looking to generate a list of voters with cell phones using
a [dummy data file](docs/quickstart.csv). We use the `assert` statements to verify that the data has been loaded
correctly.

```python
# Download the Census data from the Parsons GitHub repository
from parsons import GitHub

github = GitHub()
dummy_data = github.download_table('move-coop/parsons', 'docs/quickstart.csv')
assert dummy_data.num_rows == 1000  # Check that we got all 1,000 people

# Filter down to people with cell phones
people_with_cell_phones = dummy_data.select_rows(lambda row: row['is_cell'] == 'true')
assert people_with_cell_phones.num_rows == 498  # Check that we filtered down to our 498 people

# Extract only the columns we need (first name, last name, phone number)
people_with_cell_phones = people_with_cell_phones.cut('first_name', 'last_name', 'phone_number')
assert people_with_cell_phones.columns == ['first_name', 'last_name', 'phone_number']  # Check columns

# Output the list to a local CSV file
filename = people_with_cell_phones.to_csv()  # filename will be the path to the local CSV file

# In order to upload data to a Google Sheet, you will need to set the GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS
# environment variable
from parsons import GoogleSheets

sheets = GoogleSheets()
sheet_id = sheets.create_spreadsheet('Voter Cell Phones')
sheets.append_to_sheet(sheet_id, people_with_cell_phones)
```
