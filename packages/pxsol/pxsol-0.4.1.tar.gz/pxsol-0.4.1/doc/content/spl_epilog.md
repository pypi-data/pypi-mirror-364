# Solana/SPL Token/Epilogue

While writing this chapter, I felt a sudden creative spark. It got me thinking: is learning Solana solely on a local devnet truly the best approach? What if we tried doing something on the Solana mainnet instead? That way, both my readers and I could collaborate in a shared learning journey. You could look up blockchain history to see what I've done in the past, and also observe what other fellow learners are doing in real time. There's nothing more exciting than that!

**After months of intensive writing, Solana has convinced me that ordinary people can tell their own stories through tokens.**

My next goal is to launch a brand-new project on the Solana network: a token airdrop campaign based on Proof of Study (PoS). I want these tokens to be more than just meme vehicles, I want them to represent learning. Anyone will be able to receive an airdrop by creating their own Proof of Study. The entire process will be automated. Holding this token in your wallet will say:

"I've explored the world of Solana. I've studied this tutorial. I am part of this ecosystem."

It'll shine brightly in your wallet.

- Proof of Study won't be issued by me, it will be generated by you.
- I'll show you how to generate a proof of study in upcoming lessons.
- You can trade the airdropped tokens like any other meme coin.

The inspiration for this project comes from the open spirit of the Solana community. From the airdrop craze of Jupuary 2024 to the experimental token launches on pump.fun, airdrops have always been a driving force of the Solana ecosystem. With this PoS (Proof of Study) airdrop contract, I hope to turn every reader into an active participant in Solana's story.

I plan to complete this project in the coming weeks, publish the next chapter, and release a detailed guide for this wild idea.
