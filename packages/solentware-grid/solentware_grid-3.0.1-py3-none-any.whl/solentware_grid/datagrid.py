# DataGridBase.get_spare_row_widget is necessary in XP, but not W2000 or *nix,
# to allow resizing by mouse drag to work. In W2000 and *nix destroying and
# creating windows as needed is fine. get_spare_row_widget is used in all
# environments. XP generates <Configure> events while mouse is being dragged
# but others generate one <Configure> event when mouse released.
# If I figure a way of making mouse drag resizing work while destroying and
# creating windows under XP (or someone tells me how) then get_spare_row_widget
# can be removed.
# However it probably will remain because there is a noticable performance
# advantage in having a pool of ready made widgets for scrolling.
# Known to occur with Tcl/Tk 8.4 support for Tkinter.
# A possibly related problem appeared on upgrade to FreeBSD 8.2 Python 2.7 and
# Tcl/Tk 8.5 where the resize works slowly and with too many widgets causes the
# application to enter an infinite loop judging by CPU usage.  Traced to change
# in default for opaqueresize attribute of PanedWindow from False at Tk 8.4 to
# True at 8.5 - well adding opaqueresize=False at 8.5 fixes problem.
# Certainly a plausible reason for the XP problem, where the resize backed out
# but application never failed, if defaults were different even if Tk versions
# were same.
# A similar problem appeared running under Wine after this upgrade.  It is not
# in the straightforward refresh of the grid after scrolling the grid, but when
# repopulating the grid after a change in another widget which is neither
# ancestor descendant or sibling of the grid.  An infinite loop is entered
# which can be broken by clicking on the menu bar causing the refresh, and
# other expected actions, to complete as expected.
# The Wine problem is fixed by changing DataGridBase.add_widget_to_spare_pool
# to destroy the widget.  But this brings back the problem with drag resizing
# the application on Windows 7 (Vista and XP also I assume).
# The Microsoft Windows problem does not occur at Windows 10 with Python 3.9
# or 3.10 which is fortunate because disabling the spare widget pool by
# destroying the widget in method add_widget_to_spare_pool fixes the problem
# introduced by plugging the memory leak described in the tkinter.Misc.bind
# docstring.  See methods make_header_widgets and make_row_widgets in the
# gui.datarow module.  The problem is highlighting apparently random cells
# in the datagrid when the pointer is over a header row: it is assumed the
# highlighted cells were all in the same row before the application was
# resized.
