Description
===========

This package provides a grid to display a scrollable list of records from a database accessed using the `solentware-base`_ package.


Installation Instructions
=========================

This package is available on PyPI so can be installed by typing

   python -m pip install --user solentware-grid

at the command prompt.

See `Python`_ and `pip`_ documentation for alternatives and platform-specific points.


Notes
=====

This package was written because I could not find something which behaved like a Delphi DBGrid, as remembered from the late 1990s.
