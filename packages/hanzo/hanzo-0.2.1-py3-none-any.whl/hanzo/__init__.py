"""Hanzo AI - Complete AI Infrastructure Platform SDK.

This is the main Hanzo SDK that provides:
- Router for LLM gateway (replaces litellm)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and tools
- Agent runtime and orchestration
- Memory systems
- Network capabilities

CLI access is provided via the hanzo-cli package.
