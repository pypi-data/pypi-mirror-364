- **Redis**: In-memory caching layer for sub-second response times  
- **MCP SDK**: Natural language processing interface
- **Python**: Backend services and ML model integration
- **XGBoost + LSTM**: Pattern recognition and trend analysis models

### Rationale
These technologies are selected based on benchmarked performance requirements and compatibility with high-frequency financial data processing.
