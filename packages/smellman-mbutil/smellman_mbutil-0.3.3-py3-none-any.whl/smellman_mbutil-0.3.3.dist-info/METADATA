# MBUtil

MBUtil is a utility for importing and exporting the [MBTiles](http://mbtiles.org/) format,
typically created with [Mapbox](http://mapbox.com/) [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/).

Before exporting tiles to disk, see if there's a [Mapbox Hosting plan](http://mapbox.com/plans/)
or an open source [MBTiles server implementation](https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec/wiki/Implementations)
that works for you - tiles on disk are notoriously difficult to manage.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mapbox/mbutil.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mapbox/mbutil)

**Note well**: this project is no longer actively developed. Issues and pull requests will be attended to when possible, but delays should be expected.

## Installation

Git checkout (requires git)

    git clone https://github.com/mapbox/mbutil.git
    cd mbutil
    # get usage
    ./mb-util -h

Then to install the mb-util command globally:

    sudo python setup.py install
    # then you can run:
    mb-util

Python installation (requires easy_install)

    easy_install mbutil
    mb-util -h

## Usage

    $ mb-util -h
    Usage: mb-util [options] input output

    Examples:

        Export an mbtiles file to a directory of files:
        $ mb-util world.mbtiles tiles # tiles must not already exist

        Import a directory of tiles into an mbtiles file:
        $ mb-util tiles world.mbtiles # mbtiles file must not already exist

    Options:
      -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
      --scheme=SCHEME       Tiling scheme of the tiles. Default is "xyz" (z/x/y),
                            other options are "tms" which is also z/x/y
                            but uses a flipped y coordinate, and "wms" which replicates
                            the MapServer WMS TileCache directory structure "z/000/000/x/000/000/y.png"''',
                            and "zyx" which is the format vips dzsave --layout google uses.
      --image_format=FORMAT
                            The format of the image tiles, either png, jpg, webp or pbf
      --grid_callback=CALLBACK
                            Option to control JSONP callback for UTFGrid tiles. If
                            grids are not used as JSONP, you can
                            remove callbacks specifying --grid_callback=""
      --do_compression      Do mbtiles compression
      --silent              Dictate whether the operations should run silently


    Export an `mbtiles` file to files on the filesystem:

        mb-util World_Light.mbtiles adirectory


    Import a directory into a `mbtiles` file

        mb-util directory World_Light.mbtiles

## Requirements

* Python `>= 3.8`

## Metadata

MBUtil imports and exports metadata as JSON, in the root of the tile directory, as a file named `metadata.json`.

```javascript
{
    "name": "World Light",
    "description": "A Test Metadata",
    "version": "3"
}
```

## Testing

This project uses pytest for testing. Install pytest:

    hatch env create
    hatch test
