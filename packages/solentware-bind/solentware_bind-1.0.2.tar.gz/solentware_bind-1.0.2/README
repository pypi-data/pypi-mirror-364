Description
===========

This package provides wrappers to catch exceptions in `tkinter`_ callbacks and use the identifiers returned by tkinter bind and tag_bind methods to avoid memory leaks.  The `idlelib`_ module provided examples to follow.


Installation Instructions
=========================

This package is available on PyPI so can be installed by typing

   python -m pip install --user solentware-misc

at the command prompt.

See `Python`_ and `pip`_ documentation for alternatives and platform-specific points.


Notes
=====

The docstring for tkinter.Misc.bind() states, at Python 3.9.14, "Bind will return an identifier to allow deletion of the bound function with unbind without memory leak.".

The docstrings for tkinter.Misc.bind_all(), tkinter.Misc.bind_class(), tkinter.Canvas.tag_bind(), and tkinter.Text.tag_bind(), refer to the docstring for tkinter.Misc.bind().

Wrappers for tkinter.Misc.bind_all() and tkinter.Misc.bind_class() are not provided.

The solentware_bind project exists to avoid solentware_base and solentware_grid depending on each other.  The exceptionhandler and gridbindings modules were in solentware_misc before the bindings module was added.
