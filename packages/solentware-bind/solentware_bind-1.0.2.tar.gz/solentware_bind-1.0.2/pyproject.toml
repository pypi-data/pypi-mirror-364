# Still beta according to Python-3.10.12 built on openbsd7 on 19 June 2023.
# py3-setuptools-64.0.3p1v0 is setuptools version according to pkg_info.
# python3.10 -m pip install --user --no-index --find-links dist solentware_bind==1.0.1.dev0
# successfully installed the package so not having the setup.py script at
# setuptools.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/pyproject_config.html
# is fine.
# uci_net uses the [tool.setuptools.packages.find] section for comparison.
# Actually it does not: uci_net.samples gets a huge deprecation warning and
# having both [tool.setuptools] and [tool.setuptools.packages.find] is an
# error.
