# bedrock_server_manager/cli/server_allowlist.py
"""
Defines the `bsm allowlist` command group for managing a server's player allowlist.

This module provides CLI tools to view, add, and remove players from a
specific Bedrock server's allowlist. The allowlist controls which players
are permitted to join the server. These commands interact with the server's
``allowlist.json`` file via API calls.

Key functionalities:

    -   An interactive workflow (:func:`~.interactive_allowlist_workflow`) to
        guide users through viewing the current allowlist and adding new players.
    -   Direct commands (``bsm allowlist add``, ``bsm allowlist remove``,
        ``bsm allowlist list``) for scripting or quick, non-interactive changes.

The commands call functions from
:mod:`~bedrock_server_manager.api.server_install_config` to perform
the underlying allowlist modifications.

def interactive_allowlist_workflow(server_name: str):
    """
    Guides the user through an interactive session to view and add players to the allowlist.

    This workflow performs the following steps:

        1.  Fetches and displays the current allowlist for the specified server using
            :func:`~bedrock_server_manager.api.server_install_config.get_server_allowlist_api`.
        2.  Enters a loop prompting the user to enter gamertags of new players to add.
        3.  For each new player, it asks if they should ignore the player limit.
        4.  Checks for duplicate entries before queuing a player for addition.
        5.  If new players are added, it calls
            :func:`~bedrock_server_manager.api.server_install_config.add_players_to_allowlist_api`
            to save the changes.
        6.  Uses :func:`~.handle_api_response` to display the outcome of the save operation.

    Note:
        This interactive workflow currently only supports adding players. For
        removing players, the direct `bsm allowlist remove` command should be used.

    Args:
        server_name (str): The name of the server whose allowlist is being edited.

    Raises:
        click.Abort: If the user cancels the operation at any `questionary` prompt
                     (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C).
