# bedrock_server_manager/cli/server_permissions.py
"""
Defines the `bsm permissions` command group for managing player permission levels.

This module provides CLI tools to view and set player permission levels
(e.g., member, operator, visitor) for a specific Bedrock server. These
permissions are typically stored in the server's ``permissions.json`` file.

The commands interact with the API layer, specifically functions in
:mod:`~bedrock_server_manager.api.server_install_config` for getting and
setting permissions, and :mod:`~bedrock_server_manager.api.player` for
looking up player XUIDs from the global player database.

Key functionalities:

    -   An interactive workflow (:func:`~.interactive_permissions_workflow`) to
        guide users through selecting a player and assigning a permission level.
    -   Direct commands (``bsm permissions set``, ``bsm permissions list``) for
        scripting or quick modifications.

def interactive_permissions_workflow(server_name: str):
    """
    Guides the user through an interactive workflow to set a player's permission level.

    This function performs the following steps:

        1.  Fetches all known players from the global player database using
            :func:`~bedrock_server_manager.api.player.get_all_known_players_api`.
        2.  If no players are found, it informs the user and suggests commands to
            populate the database.
        3.  Prompts the user to select a player from the list using `questionary`.
        4.  Prompts the user to select a permission level (member, operator, visitor)
            for the chosen player.
        5.  Calls :func:`~bedrock_server_manager.api.server_install_config.configure_player_permission`
            to apply the selected permission to the specified server.
        6.  Uses :func:`~.handle_api_response` to display the outcome.

    Args:
        server_name (str): The name of the server for which to configure permissions.

    Raises:
        click.Abort: If the user cancels the operation at any `questionary` prompt
                     (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C).
