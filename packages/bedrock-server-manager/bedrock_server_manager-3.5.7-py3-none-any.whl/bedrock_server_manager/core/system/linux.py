# bedrock_server_manager/core/system/linux.py
"""Provides Linux-specific implementations for system process and service management.

This module is tailored for Linux environments and focuses on two main areas:
    1.  **Systemd User Service Management**: Functions for creating, enabling,
        disabling, and checking the existence of systemd user services. These
        are typically used to manage Bedrock servers as background daemons that
        can start on user login. Operations usually involve interaction with
        ``systemctl --user``.
    2.  **Foreground Process Management with FIFO IPC**: Functions for starting
        a Bedrock server directly in the foreground, along with mechanisms for
        Inter-Process Communication (IPC) using a Unix named pipe (FIFO). This
        allows sending commands to the running foreground server.

Key Functionality Groups:

    - **Systemd User Service Utilities** (Linux-specific):
        - :func:`.get_systemd_user_service_file_path`
        - :func:`.check_service_exists`
        - :func:`.create_systemd_service_file`
        - :func:`.enable_systemd_service`
        - :func:`.disable_systemd_service`
    - **Foreground Server Management & IPC** (Linux-specific):
        - :func:`._linux_start_server`
        - :func:`._linux_send_command`
        - :func:`._linux_stop_server`
        - Internal helpers for FIFO listener threads (:func:`._main_pipe_server_listener_thread`)
          and OS signal handling (:func:`._handle_os_signals`).

Constants:
    - :const:`.BEDROCK_EXECUTABLE_NAME`: The typical name of the Bedrock server executable on Linux.
    - :const:`.PIPE_NAME_TEMPLATE`: Template for FIFO paths used for IPC.

Global State:
    - :data:`._foreground_server_shutdown_event`: A threading event for managing
      the lifecycle of foreground server processes.

Note:
    Most functions in this module will perform a platform check and may return
    early or behave differently if not run on a Linux system.

def _linux_start_server(server_name: str, server_dir: str, config_dir: str) -> None:
    """Starts a Bedrock server in the foreground on Linux and manages its lifecycle.

    This function is the Linux equivalent of `_windows_start_server` and is
    intended to be run as the main blocking process when starting a server
    directly (not as a systemd service). It performs the following:

        1. Verifies that another instance of the same server isn't already running
           by checking PID files and process status (using :func:`core_process.get_verified_bedrock_process`).
           Cleans up stale PID files.
        2. Checks that the server executable (`bedrock_server`) exists and is executable.
        3. Creates a Unix named pipe (FIFO) for Inter-Process Communication (IPC) using
           the path from :const:`.PIPE_NAME_TEMPLATE`. Removes any pre-existing FIFO.
        4. Sets up OS signal handlers for `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) and `SIGTERM` to trigger
           graceful shutdown via :func:`._handle_os_signals`.
        5. Launches the Bedrock server executable as a subprocess.
           - `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is set to `.` in the subprocess environment to ensure
             it finds its libraries in the server directory.
           - Its stdout/stderr are redirected to `server_output.txt` in the server directory.
        6. Writes the new server process's PID to a ``bedrock_<server_name>.pid`` file
           using :func:`core_process.write_pid_to_file`.
        7. Starts a named pipe server listener thread (:func:`._main_pipe_server_listener_thread`)
           to accept commands for the Bedrock server via the created FIFO.
        8. Enters a blocking loop, waiting for the `_foreground_server_shutdown_event`
           to be set (e.g., by OS signals or if the server process dies).
        9. Upon shutdown, attempts to gracefully stop the Bedrock server by sending
           the "stop" command via its stdin, then waits for it to terminate. If it
           doesn't stop in time, it's forcibly terminated using :func:`core_process.terminate_process_by_pid`.
        10. Cleans up the PID file, FIFO, closes handles, and restores default signal handlers.

    Args:
        server_name (str): The unique name identifier for the server.
        server_dir (str): The absolute path to the server's installation directory,
            where `bedrock_server` is located.
        config_dir (str): The absolute path to the application's configuration
            directory, used for storing the PID file.

    Raises:
        MissingArgumentError: If `server_name`, `server_dir`, or `config_dir` are empty.
        ServerStartError: If the server appears to be already running, or if any
            critical step in launching the server or its IPC mechanism fails.
        AppFileNotFoundError: If `bedrock_server` (executable) is not found in `server_dir`.
        PermissionsError: If the `bedrock_server` executable is not marked as executable.
        SystemError: If creating the named pipe (FIFO) fails.
