deprecations:
  - |
    Eventlet usages are deprecated and the removal of Eventlet from
    OpenStack `is planned <https://governance.openstack.org/tc//goals/proposed/remove-eventlet.html>`_,
    for this reason, using the ``memcache_pool`` backend of oslo.cache
    in an environment using eventlet is now deprecated.
    The support of Eventlet will be soon removed from oslo.cache.

    Please start considering removing your internal Eventlet usages and
    start migrating your stack.
