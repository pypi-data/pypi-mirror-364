## Installation (for Users)

If your package is intended to be used by others, explain how they can install it via pip.

```bash
pip install sp_brew
```

---

## Example Usage

```python
from sp_brew import greet  # Replace with actual imports

# Assuming you have a function like 'greet' from a previous example
message = greet("Team!")
print(message)
```

## For Developers

This section is specifically for team members who will be contributing to the package.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Git**: For version control. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- **Python 3.11 or higher**: Our project specifically uses Python 3.11. Ensure you have it installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://python.org/).
- If you manage multiple Python versions (e.g., with pyenv or asdf), ensure Python 3.11 is active in your shell.

---

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your development environment.

#### 1. Clone the Repository

First, get a copy of the project code onto your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://git-main.smartphotonics.io/DMassella/sp_brew.git
cd sp_brew
```

#### 2. Install `uv` (Our Project Manager)

We use [uv](https://astral.sh/uv/) as our primary tool for managing Python packages and virtual environments. It's designed to be extremely fast and efficient.

If you don't have `uv` installed globally, please install it using one of the following methods:

**macOS and Linux:**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell - Run as Administrator):**

```powershell
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
```

After installation, ensure `uv` is in your system's PATH. You might need to restart your terminal or add the `uv` binary directory to your PATH environment variable (the installer usually tells you where it places the binary).

You can verify `uv` is installed by running:

```bash
uv --version
```

#### 3. Set up the Development Environment

`uv` will automatically create and manage a dedicated virtual environment for our project. This keeps project dependencies isolated from your system Python.

From the project's root directory:

```bash
uv sync
```

**What `uv sync` does:**

- Reads our project's `pyproject.toml` file to identify all required dependencies (both runtime and development dependencies).
- Creates a virtual environment named `.venv` in the project root (if one doesn't exist) using Python 3.11 (as specified in our `.python-version` file).
- Installs all necessary packages into this virtual environment.
- Generates/updates `uv.lock`, which pins exact versions of all dependencies for reproducible builds across different machines.

You are now ready to start development!

#### 4. Set up Pre-commit Hooks

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically check code formatting and quality before each commit.

After installing dependencies with `uv sync`, install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

This will ensure that every time you make a commit, formatting and linting checks are run automatically.

To manually run all pre-commit checks on all files (recommended before pushing):

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

If any checks fail, follow the instructions in the terminal to fix the issues and re-commit.

---

### Working with the Project

#### Running Tests

We use `pytest` for writing and running our tests. `pytest` is installed as a development dependency.

To run all tests:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

To see more detailed test output (e.g., which tests were collected):

```bash
uv run pytest -v
```

To run tests and generate a coverage report (showing which lines of code are covered by tests):

```bash
uv run pytest --cov=sp_brew --cov-report=term-missing
```

For a detailed HTML coverage report (which you can open in your browser):

```bash
uv run pytest --cov=sp_brew --cov-report=html
```

This will create an `htmlcov/` folder. Open `htmlcov/index.html` in your web browser.

---

#### Adding Dependencies

If your feature requires a new Python package, add it using `uv`:

- **Runtime Dependency** (required by the package itself):

  ```bash
  uv add <package-name>
  # Example:
  uv add requests
  ```

- **Development Dependency** (e.g., for testing, linting, or building tools):

  ```bash
  uv add <package-name> --dev
  # Example:
  uv add black --dev  # for code formatting
  ```

`uv` will automatically update `pyproject.toml`, install the package into your `.venv`, and update `uv.lock`.

---

#### Running Scripts/Commands

You can execute any Python script or command within the project's virtual environment using `uv run` without needing to manually activate the environment:

```bash
uv run python examples/simple.py  # Example for running a specific script
```

---

#### Managing the Virtual Environment

Normally, `uv` handles the virtual environment for you. However, if you ever need to manually activate it (e.g., to use pip directly, though `uv` is preferred), you can:

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**

```dos
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Once activated, your terminal prompt will typically show `(.venv)` to indicate the environment is active. To deactivate:

```bash
deactivate
```

### Git Workflow

This project uses Git for version control. Here's a basic workflow for collaboration:

#### Initial Setup for Collaboration

If you cloned the repository, you already have the `origin` remote configured. You can verify it:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see output similar to:

```
origin  https://git-main.smartphotonics.io/DMassella/sp_brew.git (fetch)
origin  https://git-main.smartphotonics.io/DMassella/sp_brew.git (push)
```

#### Keeping Your Local Branch Updated

Before starting new work or pushing changes, always pull the latest changes from the remote:

```bash
git pull origin main  # Or 'master', depending on your main branch name
```

#### Pushing Your Changes

Once your changes are committed locally, push them to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin main  # Or 'master'
```

If it's your first time pushing a new local branch, you might need to set the upstream:

```bash
git push -u origin <your-new-branch-name>
```

## Documentation

We use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) to automatically generate project documentation from docstrings and source files.

### Building and Updating the Documentation

1. **Make sure all dependencies are installed:**

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. **(Optional) Regenerate API documentation stubs if you added/removed modules:**

   From the `docs/source` directory, run:
   ```bash
   uv run sphinx-apidoc -o . ../../src/sp_brew
   ```

3. **Build the HTML documentation:**

   From the `docs/source` directory, run:
   ```bash
   uv run sphinx-build -b html . ../build
   ```

   The generated HTML files will be in `docs/build`. Open `docs/build/index.html` in your browser to view the documentation.
