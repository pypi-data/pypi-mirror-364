# GUMP: Generalized Parton Distributions through Universal Moment Parameterization

This repository contains the source code for the **Generalized Parton Distributions through Universal Moment Parameterization (GUMP)** program, designed for global analysis of GPDs.

## Overview

- **GPD Calculations:**  
  The script under folder `/tests` provides example workflows to generate PDFs, GPDs and cross-sections using GUMP parameters obtained from the fitting program.

- **Performance Note:**  
  Evaluating GPDs can be computationally intensive, as it involves QCD evolution in moment space and numerical contour integrals to transform back to the momentum fraction (x) space.
