# LANA-1028

LANA-1028 is a custom encryption algorithm designed for high security and strong cryptographic resistance. It uses a 1028-bit key, multiple rounds of encryption, and advanced substitution and permutation techniques to ensure data confidentiality.

## Features

- **1028-bit encryption key** for strong security
- **64 rounds** of encryption for enhanced protection
- **SHA-512-based key expansion**
- **Non-linear substitution (S-Box)** and **bitwise permutation (P-Box)**
- Easy-to-use API for encryption and decryption

## Installation

Install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install lana1028
