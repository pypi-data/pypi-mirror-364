- `/tests/test_hook_integration.py` - Hook integration with orchestrator

### Implementation-dependent Tests (1 file)
- `/tests/test_cli.py` - CLI tests that were tightly coupled to old MPMOrchestrator implementation

## Total Files Deleted: 20

## Rationale

All deleted test files were importing from `claude_mpm.orchestration.*` modules that have been archived. These modules included:
- SubprocessOrchestrator
- MPMOrchestrator  
- TicketExtractor
- AgentDelegator
- Various other orchestration components

Since the orchestration system has been simplified to use `SimpleClaudeRunner` from `core.simple_runner`, these tests were no longer valid and could not be easily salvaged without completely rewriting them for the new architecture.

## Remaining Test Suite

The remaining test suite should focus on:
- Core functionality tests
- Agent system tests
- Hook system tests
- Service layer tests
- Any other tests that don't depend on the archived orchestration modules
