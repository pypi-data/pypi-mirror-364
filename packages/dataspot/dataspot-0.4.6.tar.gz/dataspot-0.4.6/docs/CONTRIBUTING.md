## Your First Code Contribution

Ready to contribute code? Here's how to set up `Dataspot` for local development.

1. **Fork the repository:** Fork the project on GitHub and then clone your fork locally.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:your-username/dataspot.git
    cd dataspot
    ```

2. **Set up the Development Environment:** The project includes a development setup that installs all necessary tools like `pytest`, `mypy`, and `ruff`.

    ```bash
    # This command installs Dataspot in editable mode and all dev dependencies
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```

    This ensures you have the exact same environment the project's CI uses. We recommend using a Python virtual environment.

3. **Create a branch:** Create a new branch for your changes from the `main` branch.

    ```bash
    # Use a descriptive branch name like 'feature/new-thing' or 'fix/bug-name'
    git checkout -b feature/add-new-export-format
    ```

4. **Make Your Changes:** Write the code for your new feature or bug fix.

5. **Run Tests and Linters:** We use a `Makefile` to run quality checks. Before committing, please run our full suite to ensure your changes pass all checks.

    ```bash
    # This runs all linters (ruff, mypy) and tests (pytest)
    make check

    # You can also run them individually
    make lint
    make tests
    ```

6. **Commit Your Changes:** We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This helps us automate versioning and changelogs.

    ```bash
    # Examples:
    # feat: Add support for exporting patterns to JSON
    # fix: Correctly handle datasets with null values
    # docs: Update README with new performance benchmarks
    git commit -m "feat: Your descriptive commit message"
    ```

7. **Push and Open a Pull Request:** Push your branch to your fork on GitHub and open a Pull Request to the `main` branch of `frauddi/dataspot`.
    - Provide a clear description of the problem and solution in your PR.
    - Include the relevant issue number (e.g., `Closes #123`).
    - Be responsive to feedback from the maintainers.

We will review your PR as soon as possible. Thank you for your contribution!
