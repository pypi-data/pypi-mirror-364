# Entity - A Cross-Platform LLM Agent

Entity is a Python-based AI agent designed to interact with your operating system, execute commands, and control programs across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Architecture

This agent uses a local Large Language Model (LLM) powered by Ollama. This ensures that all data and interactions remain private and on your local machine.

The core components are:
- **Agent Logic:** The main Python application that orchestrates tasks.
- **LLM Service:** An Ollama server running a local model (e.g., Llama 3).
- **Platform Interaction:** Modules for interacting with the specific operating system's terminal and applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed and running.
- A downloaded Ollama model (e.g., `ollama run llama3`)


### Installation

#### From PyPI (recommended)

```bash
pip install entityagent
```

#### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prakashsellathurai/entity
cd entity
pip install .
```

### Running the Agent

You can run the agent from the command line:

```bash
entity-agent
```
or
```bash
python -m entityAgent.agent
```


## Usage

You can interact with the agent in two ways:

1.  **Natural Language:**
    ```
    > Tell me a joke.
    > What is the capital of France?
    ```

2.  **Commands:**
    -   **Execute a shell command:**
        ```
        > run: ls -l
        ```
    -   **List running processes:**
        ```
        > run: list_processes
        ```

## Testing

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
pytest
```
