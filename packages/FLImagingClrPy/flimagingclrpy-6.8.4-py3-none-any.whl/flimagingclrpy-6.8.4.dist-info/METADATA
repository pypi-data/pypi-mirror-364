# FLImagingClrPy  
FLImaging CLR for Python  
---

**FLImagingClrPy** is a lightweight helper package that automatically sets up the initial environment to seamlessly import the **.NET CLR wrapper (FLImagingCLR.dll)**—built on top of the **commercial machine vision library FLImaging®**'s native C++ engine—directly into Python.  
It simplifies the use of `clr.AddReference()` through `pythonnet` (or `pythonnet_win64`), and minimizes common barriers to entry such as version or architecture mismatches, DLL search paths, and license dongle detection.

## 🖥️ Supported Environment

### 🧩 Operating System
* Supports **Windows 7 SP1** through **Windows 11 24H2** (both x86 and x64).  
  Linux is not supported at this time.

### 🧪 Development Tools
* **Python 3.7 ~ 3.12** (64-bit recommended)  
* **.NET Framework 4.8** or **.NET 6/7 Runtime**  
* **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015–2022** (required for native DLL execution)

## ⚡ Optional: Deep Learning Hardware Acceleration

To accelerate the **FLImaging® AI modules** with GPU, the following additional system requirements apply:

| Category | Minimum Specification | Recommended Specification |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| CPU     | x64 with 4+ cores      | x64 with 32+ cores         |
| RAM     | 32 GB for training / 16 GB for inference | 256 GB for training / 64 GB for inference |
| RAM Type | DDR4 or higher        | DDR5 or higher             |
| NVIDIA GPU | **Ampere** (e.g., RTX 3000, A100) | **Ada Lovelace** (e.g., RTX 4000/5000, H100) |
| NVIDIA Driver | Setup Package 572.61+, internal version 32.0.15.7261+ | Latest Game Ready / Studio Driver |
| OS | Windows 10 or higher | Windows 11 or higher |

> 💡 **TIP**: Even without a GPU, CPU-only inference is possible.  
> However, for large model training or real-time processing, the recommended specs are strongly advised.
