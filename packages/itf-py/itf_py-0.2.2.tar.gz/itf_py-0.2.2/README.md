# ITF-py: Parser and Encoder for the ITF Trace Format

Python library to parse and emit Apalache ITF traces. Refer to
[ADR015](https://apalache-mc.org/docs/adr/015adr-trace.html) for the format. ITF
traces are emitted by [Apalache](https://github.com/apalache-mc/apalache) and
[Quint](https://github.com/informalsystems/quint).

**Intentionally minimalistic.** We keep this library intentionally minimalistic.
You can use it in your projects without worrying about pulling dozens of
dependencies.
