The ReciPies package is a preprocessing framework operating on [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars)
and [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) dataframes. The backend can be chosen by the user.
The operation of this package is inspired by the R-package [recipes](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/).
This package allows the user to apply a number of extensible operations for imputation, feature generation/extraction,
scaling, and encoding.
It operates on modified Dataframe objects from the established data science package Pandas.
## Installation

You can install ReciPies from pip using:

```
pip install recipies
```

> Note that the package is called `recipies`  on pip.
>
You can install ReciPies from source to ensure you have the latest version:

```
conda env update -f environment.yml
conda activate ReciPies
pip install -e .
```

> Note that the last command installs the package called `recipies`.

## Usage

To define preprocessing operations, one has to supply _roles_ to the different columns of the Dataframe.
This allows the user to create groups of columns which have a particular function.
Then, we provide several "steps" that can be applied to the datasets, among which: Historical accumulation,
Resampling the time resolution, A number of imputation methods, and a wrapper for any
[Scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) preprocessing step.
We believe to have covered any basic preprocessing needs for prepared datasets.
Any missing step can be added by following the step interface.
