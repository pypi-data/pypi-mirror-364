# üé• sh2mp4

Records a shell script to mp4.

```bash
$ ./sh2mp4.sh "command to run" [output.mp4] [cols] [lines] [fps] [font] [font_size] [theme]
```

I set up a stdbuf fifo so you should be able to pipe stuff like keypresses
in, but it's untested and you won't be able to see what you're doing
either. Might be useful though.

## Fonts

Font size is configurable (default 12pt). Character dimensions are automatically 
calculated based on the font size. Supported sizes: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.
Run `python3 measure_fonts.py` to see pixel dimensions for all available fonts and sizes.

## Themes

Available themes:
- `sh2mp4`: Custom theme optimized for video recording (default)
- `tango`: Tango-based theme
- `dark`: High-contrast dark theme
- `light`: Light theme
- `solarized-dark`: Solarized Dark theme

You can customize or add new themes in the `themes.sh` file.

## Deps

See/run `./configure` for a list. There's a few, so you might wanna run it in a
container.
