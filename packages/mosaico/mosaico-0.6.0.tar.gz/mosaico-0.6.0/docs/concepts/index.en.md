# Concepts

## Overview

Mosaico is built around several core concepts that work together to create video compositions:

- [Media and Assets](media-and-assets.md): Raw content and production-ready elements
- [Positioning System](positioning.md): Placement and layout control
- [Asset References and Scenes](asset-references-and-scenes.md): Timeline organization
- [Video Projects](video-projects.md): High-level video compositions
- [Script Generators](script-generators.md): Automated content creation
- [Effects](effects.md): Dynamic animations and visual effects
