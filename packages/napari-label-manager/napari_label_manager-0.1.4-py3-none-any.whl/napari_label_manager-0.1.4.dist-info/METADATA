## Description
This is a plugin for management of label colormap generation and opacity control.
- Select your label layer from the dropdown
- Generate a new colormap or use existing colors
- Specify target label IDs (e.g., "1-5,10,15-20")
- Adjust opacity for selected labels and background
- Apply changes to visualize your selection

## Features

### Label Management
- Batch management of label colors and opacity
- Random colormap generation with customizable seeds
- Support for label ID ranges and individual selections
- Quick presets for common label selections (first 10, even/odd IDs, all current)

### Label Annotation
- **NEW**: Excel-like annotation table for labeling digital IDs
- Fill ranges of label IDs automatically
- Load current layer's labels into annotation table
- Add custom annotations/descriptions for each label
- Export annotations to Excel format (.xlsx)

### Performance Optimizations
- Memory-efficient processing for large datasets
- Time-series optimization (processes current slice only)
- Smart sampling strategies for extremely large arrays
- Background computation to maintain UI responsiveness
