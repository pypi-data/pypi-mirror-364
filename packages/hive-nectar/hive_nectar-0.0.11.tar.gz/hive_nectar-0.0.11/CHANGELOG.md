# Changelog

## 0.0.10 - 2025-07-12

- Emergency hotfix: lower-case the UTC timestamp suffix during permlink generation (in `derive_permlink`) to resolve validation errors caused by the uppercase `U`.

## 0.0.9 - 2025-07-12

- Refactored `nodelist` logic:
  - `update_nodes` now reads authoritative node metadata from `nectarflower` account `json_metadata` only.
  - Uses `weighted_score` directly for ranking and zeroes scores for nodes missing from the report.
  - Dynamically adds new nodes from the report and failing list, ensuring completeness.
  - Removed unused fall-back paths and cleaned up internal code.
