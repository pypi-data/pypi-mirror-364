A simple, robust command-line tool for viewing and editing FITS file headers.

## ðŸš€ Installation

Install `CLFits` directly from PyPI:

## âœ¨ Quick Start

`CLFits` provides a straightforward, command-based interface for header manipulation.

**View the entire header:**

```bash
clfits view my_image.fits
```

**Get the value of a specific keyword:**

```bash
clfits get my_image.fits OBJECT
```

**Set a keyword's value and comment:**

```bash
clfits set my_image.fits OBJECT "NGC 4993" --comment "Corrected object name"
```

**Delete a keyword:**

```bash
clfits del my_image.fits HISTORY
```
