# `dbami`: The database friend you didn't know you needed

A lightweight, Python-based, framework-agnostic, async-compatible PostgreSQL
migration tool.

## What does `dbami` mean?

`dbami` was initially inspired by the tool
[`dbmate`](https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate), and therefore takes inspiration
from `dbmate` when it comes to name. That is, "ami" is French for "friend," a
synonym of "mate."

Other languages may have yielded suitable words for friend, but "ami" was
chosen due to its short length (easier to type) and the allowance for a future
golang-based implementation, which, most serendipitously, could be named
`dbamigo`.
