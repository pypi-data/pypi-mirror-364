pip install sagemaker_jupyterlab_extension-<version>-py3-none-any.whl`
```

## Uninstalling the extension

## Troubleshooting
If you are seeing the frontend extension, but it is not working, check that the server extension is enabled:

```
jupyter serverextension list
```

If the server extension is installed and enabled, but you are not seeing the frontend extension, check the frontend extension is installed:
```
jupyter labextension list
```

If the frontend extension is installed and enabled, open Browser console and see if there are any JavaScript error that is related to the extension in Browser console.
