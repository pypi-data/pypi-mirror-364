## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3 (comes pre-installed on most systems)

### Running the CLI

After installation, you can run the CLI from anywhere:

```bash
gh-feed <github_username>
```

Or, if you want to run the script directly (if you have the source):

```bash
python3 app.py <github_username>
```

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Get user activity
gh-feed octocat

# Show version
gh-feed --version
gh-feed -v

# Show help
gh-feed --help
gh-feed -h

# Interactive mode
gh-feed --interactive
```

### Filtering Events

You can filter by event type (e.g., only show push events):

```bash
gh-feed octocat --filter PushEvent
```

### Exporting to JSON

Export the latest events to a file:

```bash
gh-feed octocat --json
```

You can combine filtering and export:

```bash
gh-feed octocat --filter IssuesEvent --json
```

### Using a GitHub Token

To increase your API rate limit, you can provide a personal access token:

```bash
gh-feed octocat --token <your_github_token>
```

Or set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
gh-feed octocat
```

### Interactive Mode

Start an interactive session for guided usage:

```bash
gh-feed --interactive
```
You'll be prompted for the username, event filter, token, and export options.

### Caching

API responses are cached for 5 minutes in the `~/.cache/gh-feed/` directory to reduce API calls and speed up repeated queries.

### Update Notifications

The tool automatically checks for new versions when you run commands and notifies you if an update is available:

```
üì¶ New version available: 0.1.4 (current: 0.1.3)
üí° Run 'pip install --upgrade gh-feed' to update
```

### Example

```bash
gh-feed octocat
```

Sample output:
```
- Pushed 2 commits to octocat/Hello-World (3h ago)
- Opened an issue in octocat/Hello-World (5h ago)
- Starred octocat/Spoon-Knife (1d ago)

Summary:
- push commit: 1
- issue opened: 1
- repo starred: 1
- Activity in 3 repos
```
