3. Target: `main` (after merge)
4. Use the release description from RELEASE_INSTRUCTIONS.md
5. Upload the two ZIP packages

### 5. Update Branch Protection (Optional)
Since you have branch protection on ocr-final-clean:

- Add branch protection to main instead
- This prevents accidental pushes to production

After these steps:
- GitHub main branch will show v3.1.0

- Tag v3.1.0 will be visible

## üì¶ Don't Forget
- Build the packages first: `python build_ocr_packages.py`
- Both packages must be uploaded:
  - Universal-Document-Converter-v3.1.0-Windows-Complete.zip
  - UniversalConverter32.dll.zip
