# Merge Strategy for v3.1.0 Release

## Current Situation
- **main branch**: Shows old version (no OCR features)
- **ocr-final-clean**: Has v2.1.0 (8 hours ago)
- **feature/resolve-ocr-weaknesses**: Has v3.1.0 (current branch, fully updated)

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Direct to Main (Recommended)
Since we have v3.1.0 ready with all fixes:

```bash
# 1. Push current branch
git push origin feature/resolve-ocr-weaknesses

# 2. Push the tag
git push origin v3.1.0

# 3. Create PR directly to main
# Go to: https://github.com/Beaulewis1977/quick_ocr_doc_converter
# Create PR: feature/resolve-ocr-weaknesses → main
# Title: "Release v3.1.0 - OCR Document Converter with Enterprise Features"

# 4. Merge the PR
```

### Option 2: Update ocr-final-clean First
If you want to maintain branch history:

```bash
# 1. Merge current work into ocr-final-clean
git checkout ocr-final-clean
git pull origin ocr-final-clean
git merge feature/resolve-ocr-weaknesses
git push origin ocr-final-clean

# 2. Then merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge ocr-final-clean
git push origin main

# 3. Push tag
git push origin v3.1.0
```

## Why v3.1.0 Instead of v2.1.0?

1. **Major Feature Addition**: OCR is a significant feature
2. **Breaking Changes**: New file structure and dependencies
3. **Clear Versioning**: Shows progression from non-OCR → OCR versions
4. **Already Tagged**: We've already created v3.1.0 tag

## After Merge

The main branch will show:
- Version: v3.1.0
- Latest commit: "feat: Release v3.1.0 - OCR Document Converter"
- All OCR features included
- VFP9/VB6 support
- Updated documentation

## PyPI Publishing

Since you have the PyPI account ready:

```bash
# After merge to main
python -m build
python -m twine upload dist/*
```
