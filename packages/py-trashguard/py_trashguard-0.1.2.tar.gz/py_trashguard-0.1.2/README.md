# py-trashguard

A safe, user-friendly alternative to `os.remove()` that moves files to a `.trash/` folder instead of deleting them permanently. Use it as a Python API or a CLI tool to protect your files from accidental deletion.

## Features
- **Soft-delete files:** Move files to a `.trash/` directory instead of permanent removal
- **Restore files:** Bring back files from the trash easily
- **List trashed files:** See whatâ€™s in your trash
- **No dependencies:** 100% Python standard library
