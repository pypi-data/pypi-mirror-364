### Via Command Line Testing

You can also test the CSS extractor directly:

```

This will analyze several sample websites and show the extraction results.

## Technical Details

### Supported Patterns

The extractor looks for common article URL patterns:
- `/article/`
- `/post/`
- `/news/`
- `/story/`
- `/blog/`
- Date patterns like `/2024/01/`
- Full date patterns `/2024/01/15/`

### Filtering Logic

The system automatically excludes:
- Navigation links (`/category/`, `/tag/`, `/author/`)
- Utility pages (`/contact`, `/about`, `/privacy`)
- Media files (`.css`, `.js`, `.png`, etc.)
- External domains (focuses on the target website)
- JavaScript and mailto links

### Selector Generation

The extractor generates various CSS selector types:
- **Simple tag selectors**: `a`, `h2 a`
- **Class-based selectors**: `.article-link`, `a.post-title`
- **Hierarchical selectors**: `article a`, `.content h2 a`
- **Attribute selectors**: `a[href*="/article/"]`
- **Complex combinations**: `.post-list .entry-title a`

### Effectiveness Scoring

Selectors are ranked based on:
- **Precision**: Percentage of matches that are actual articles
- **Coverage**: Number of article links captured
- **Frequency**: How often the pattern appears
- **Specificity**: How targeted the selector is
