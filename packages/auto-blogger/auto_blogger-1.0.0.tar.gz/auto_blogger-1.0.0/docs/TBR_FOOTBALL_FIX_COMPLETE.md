# TBR Football Scraping Issue - Complete Fix Guide

## Issue Summary
The error "No articles were processed" indicates that the automation system cannot find any articles using the current configuration.

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue is with the article selector `article.article h2 a` not matching the current structure of the TBR Football website, or the website being inaccessible.

## Immediate Solutions

### Solution 1: Use Updated Configuration (RECOMMENDED)
The default configuration has been updated to use Sky Sports as a more reliable source:
- **Source URL**: `https://www.skysports.com/premier-league-news`
- **Article Selector**: `.news-list__item .news-list__headline-link`

**Steps to apply:**
1. Restart the application
2. The new configuration will load automatically
3. Test using the "Test Configuration" button
4. Run automation

### Solution 2: Fix TBR Football Specifically
If you want to continue using TBR Football, try these alternative selectors:

1. Open Configuration tab
2. Change the "Article Selector" to one of these:
   - `article h2 a`
   - `article h3 a`
   - `h2 a`
   - `a[href*='tbrfootball.com']`

### Solution 3: Use Alternative News Sources
Created alternative configurations for reliable sources:

1. **Sky Sports**: `configs/sky_sports_alternative.json`
2. **BBC Sport**: Use selector `.gs-c-promo-heading__title`
3. **Football365**: Use selector `.teaser-title a`
