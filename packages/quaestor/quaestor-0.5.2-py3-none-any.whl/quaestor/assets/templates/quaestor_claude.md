## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: MANDATORY RULES ENFORCEMENT

**BEFORE READING FURTHER**: Load and validate [CRITICAL_RULES.md](./.quaestor/CRITICAL_RULES.md)

<!-- DATA:rule-validation:START -->
```yaml
rule_enforcement:
  status: "ACTIVE"
  mode: "STRICT"
  validation_required: "BEFORE_EVERY_ACTION"
  violations_allowed: 0
  consequences: "IMMEDIATE_STOP"
```
<!-- DATA:rule-validation:END -->

### Pre-Action Checklist (MANDATORY)

<!-- CHECKLIST:pre-action:START -->
- [ ] Have I loaded CRITICAL_RULES.md?
- [ ] Am I following Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement?
- [ ] Have I checked complexity triggers?
- [ ] Am I using multiple agents when appropriate?
- [ ] Is my approach production-quality?
<!-- CHECKLIST:pre-action:END -->

<!-- CRITICAL:rules:enforcement:END -->

## Important
- **Production Quality**: We're building production-quality code TOGETHER. Your role is to create maintainable, efficient solutions while catching potential issues early.
- **Mandatory Compliance**: ALL instructions within this document MUST BE FOLLOWED, these are not optional unless explicitly stated.
- **Ask for Help**: ASK FOR CLARIFICATION when you seem stuck or overly complex, I'll redirect you - my guidance helps you stay on track.
- **Reference Examples**: When in doubt about implementation details, refer to the existing `/examples` implementation as a reference.
- **CRITICAL**: Rules in [CRITICAL_RULES.md](./.quaestor/CRITICAL_RULES.md) override everything else.

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW

### Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement [ENFORCED BY CRITICAL_RULES.md]

**NEVER JUMP STRAIGHT TO CODING!** See CRITICAL_RULES.md for the mandatory Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement workflow.

**Required Response**: When asked to implement any feature, you MUST say: "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

**Ultrathink Trigger**: For complex architectural decisions or challenging problems, use **"ultrathink"** to engage maximum reasoning capacity.

**Required Response**: "Let me ultrathink about this architecture before proposing a solution."

### USE MULTIPLE AGENTS! [ENFORCED BY CRITICAL_RULES.md]

See CRITICAL_RULES.md for mandatory agent usage triggers and requirements.

**Required Response**: You MUST say: "I'll spawn agents to tackle different aspects of this problem" whenever a task has multiple independent parts.

### Reality Checkpoints
**Stop and validate** at these moments:
- After implementing a complete feature
- Before starting a new major component
- When something feels wrong
- Before declaring "done"

Run your project's test suite regularly (see Testing section below).

## Working Memory Management

### When context gets long:
- Re-read this CLAUDE.md file
- Check MEMORY.md for current project status
- Document current state before major changes

### Maintain MEMORY.md:
Track progress in [MEMORY.md](./.quaestor/MEMORY.md) with sections for:
- **Current Status**: What phase/milestone you're in
- **Active Work**: Current approach and tasks
- **Timeline**: Goals and progress
- **Next Actions**: Immediate, short-term, and long-term tasks

### Problem-Solving Together

<!-- WORKFLOW:problem-solving:START -->
When you're stuck or confused:
1. **Stop** - Don't spiral into complex solutions
2. **Delegate** - Consider spawning agents for parallel investigation
3. **Ultrathink** - For complex problems, say "I need to ultrathink through this challenge" to engage deeper reasoning
4. **Step back** - Re-read the requirements
5. **Simplify** - The simple solution is usually correct
6. **Ask** - "I see two approaches: [A] vs [B]. Which do you prefer?"
<!-- WORKFLOW:problem-solving:END -->

**Remember**: My insights on better approaches are valued - please ask for them!

# WORKFLOW HOOKS

### Automated Milestone Commits

<!-- SECTION:workflow-hooks:START -->
## Workflow Automation Hooks

<!-- DATA:hook-configuration:START -->
```yaml
workflow_hooks:
  after_memory_update:
    trigger: "MEMORY.md modified"
    conditions:
      - "Contains completed TODO items"
      - "Milestone progress changed"
    actions:
      - scan_for_completed_todos: "Check TODO status"
      - run_milestone_commit: "Auto-commit completed work"
    command: "/quaestor:milestone-commit"
  
  after_todo_completion:
    trigger: "TodoWrite marks item as completed"
    conditions:
      - "All related changes saved"
      - "Quality checks passing"
    actions:
      - update_memory_progress: "Sync to MEMORY.md"
      - trigger_milestone_commit: "Create atomic commit"
    automatic: true
  
  after_task_success:
    trigger: "Task command completes successfully"
    conditions:
      - "All checks green"
      - "TODO marked complete"
    actions:
      - commit_changes: "Create commit for task"
      - update_tracking: "Update progress"
    prompt_user: false
  
  milestone_completion:
    trigger: "All TODOs in milestone done"
    conditions:
      - "All items completed"
      - "Quality gates passed"
    actions:
      - create_pr: "Generate pull request"
      - notify_completion: "Update status"
    require_confirmation: true
```
<!-- DATA:hook-configuration:END -->

### Hook Usage

**Automatic Triggers**:
- Completing a TODO automatically triggers commit workflow
- Updating MEMORY.md with progress runs milestone checks
- Finishing all items in a milestone creates a PR

**Manual Override**:
```bash
# Disable hooks temporarily
/quaestor:milestone-commit --no-hooks

# Run hooks manually
/quaestor:milestone-commit --trigger
```

**Benefits**:
- üéØ Atomic commits for each completed task
- üìä Automatic progress tracking
- üîç Quality enforcement before commits
- üöÄ PRs created at milestone boundaries
