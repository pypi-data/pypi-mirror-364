###### configuring what to type check and where to import from

# check all files in "."
project-includes = ["."]
# exclude dotfiles
project-excludes = ["**/.[!/.]*", "**/*venv/**"]
# import project files from "."
search-path = ["."]
# do not include any third-party packages
site-package-path = []

###### configuring your python environment

# assume we're running on linux, regardless of the actual current platform
python-platform = "linux"
# assume the Python version we're using is 3.10, without querying an interpreter
python-version = "3.12"
# query the default Python interpreter on your system, if installed
# and `python_platform`, `python-version`, or `site-package-path` are unset.
# python-interpreter = null # this is commented out because there are no `null` values in TOML

#### configuring your type check settings

replace-imports-with-any = []
ignore-errors-in-generated-code = false
use-untyped-imports = false
ignore-missing-source = false

[errors]
# this is an empty table, meaning all errors are enabled by default

# no `[[sub-config]]` entries are included, since there are none by default
