The project also contains a small flask server for adjudicating and visualizing
election results from a CSV file.  It is automatically deployed at at `pyrcv.org`_

Inspired by FairVote_ and CalRCV_.  FairVote's examples were extremely helpful for
development and correctness-testing.

This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template.
