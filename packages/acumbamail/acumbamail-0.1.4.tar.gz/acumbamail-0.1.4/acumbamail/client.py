    This class provides a comprehensive interface to perform all available operations
    in the Acumbamail API, including mailing list management, campaign creation and

    The client handles authentication, rate limiting, error processing, and response
    parsing automatically. It uses httpx for HTTP requests and provides a clean,
    Pythonic interface to the Acumbamail API.
