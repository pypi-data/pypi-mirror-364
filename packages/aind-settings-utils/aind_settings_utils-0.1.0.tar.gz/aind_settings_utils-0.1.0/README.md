## Usage

This package is intended to be installed as a utility package alongside apps.

### App settings store as a json file in AWS Parameter store.

AWS credentials are handled by boto3.

If you have a parameter in Parameter store under:
```bash
/dev/my_param
```

with contents:
```
{"app_name": "my app", "app_arg1": 3}
```

then you can pull that information into a settings class like:
```python
from aind_settings_utils.aws import (
    ParameterStoreAppBaseSettings,
)

class ExampleSettings(ParameterStoreAppBaseSettings):

    app_name: str
    app_arg1: int

    model_config = {
        "aws_param_store_name": "/dev/my_param",  # Or pull it from an env var
        "case_sensitive": False,
    }

```

You can then import and create an `ExampleSettings` class:

```python
example_settings = ExampleSettings()
print(example_settings.app_name)
print(example_settings.app_arg1)
```


## Contributing

Clone this repo and install the development packages locally:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Linters and testing

There are several libraries used to run linters, check documentation, and run tests.

- Please test your changes using the **coverage** library, which will run the tests and log a coverage report:

```bash
coverage run -m unittest discover && coverage report
```

- Use **interrogate** to check that modules, methods, etc. have been documented thoroughly:

```bash
interrogate .
```

- Use **flake8** to check that code is up to standards (no unused imports, etc.):
```bash
flake8 .
```

- Use **black** to automatically format the code into PEP standards:
```bash
black .
```

- Use **isort** to automatically sort import statements:
```bash
isort .
```

### Pull requests

For internal members, please create a branch. For external members, please fork the repository and open a pull request from the fork. We'll primarily use [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit) style for commit messages. Roughly, they should follow the pattern:
```text
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

where scope (optional) describes the packages affected by the code changes and type (mandatory) is one of:

- **build**: Changes that affect build tools or external dependencies (example scopes: pyproject.toml, setup.py)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (examples: .github/workflows/ci.yml)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bugfix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### Semantic Release

The table below, from [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), shows which commit message gets you which release type when `semantic-release` runs (using the default configuration):
