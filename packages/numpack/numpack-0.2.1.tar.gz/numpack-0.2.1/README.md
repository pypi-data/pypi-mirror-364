## Usage

### Basic Operations

```python
import numpy as np
from numpack import NumPack

# Create a NumPack instance
npk = NumPack("data_directory")

# Save arrays
arrays = {
    'array1': np.random.rand(1000, 100).astype(np.float32),
    'array2': np.random.rand(500, 200).astype(np.float32)
}
npk.save(arrays)

# Load arrays
# Normal mode
loaded = npk.load("array1")

# lazy load
lazy_array = npk.load("arr1", lazy=True)
```

### Advanced Operations

```python
# Replace specific rows
replacement = np.random.rand(10, 100).astype(np.float32)
npk.replace({'array1': replacement}, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])  # Using list indices
npk.replace({'array1': replacement}, slice(0, 10))  # Using slice notation

# Append new arrays
new_arrays = {
    'array3': np.random.rand(200, 100).astype(np.float32)
}
npk.append(new_arrays)

# Drop arrays or specific rows
npk.drop('array1')  # Drop entire array
npk.drop(['array1', 'array2'])  # Drop multiple arrays
npk.drop('array2', [0, 1, 2])  # Drop specific rows

# Random access operations
data = npk.getitem('array1', [0, 1, 2])  # Access specific rows
data = npk.getitem('array1', slice(0, 10))  # Access using slice
data = npk['array1']  # Dictionary-style access for entire array

# Metadata operations
shapes = npk.get_shape()  # Get shapes of all arrays
shapes = npk.get_shape('array1')  # Get shape of specific array
members = npk.get_member_list()  # Get list of array names
mtime = npk.get_modify_time('array1')  # Get modification time
metadata = npk.get_metadata()  # Get complete metadata

# Stream loading for large arrays
for batch in npk.stream_load('array1', buffer_size=1000):
    # Process 1000 rows at a time
    process_batch(batch)

# Reset/clear storage
npk.reset()  # Clear all arrays

# Iterate over all arrays
for array_name in npk:
    data = npk[array_name]
    print(f"{array_name} shape: {data.shape}")
```

### Lazy Loading and Buffer Operations

NumPack supports lazy loading and buffer operations, which are particularly useful for handling large-scale datasets. Using the `lazy=True` parameter enables data to be loaded only when actually needed, making it ideal for streaming processing or scenarios where only partial data access is required.

```python
from numpack import NumPack
import numpy as np

# Create NumPack instance and save large-scale data
npk = NumPack("test_data/", drop_if_exists=True)
a = np.random.random((1000000, 128))  # Create a large array
npk.save({"arr1": a})

# Lazy loading - keeps data in buffer
lazy_array = npk.load("arr1", lazy=True)  # LazyArray Object

# Perform computations with lazy-loaded data
# Only required data is loaded into memory
similarity_scores = np.inner(a[0], npk.load("arr1", lazy=True))
```

## Performance
