from dxpars.document import Document

# Load a document
document = Document('path/document.docx')

```

### Working with Formatting

```python
# Extract headings
for paragraph in document.paragraphs:
    if paragraph.pstyle is not None:
        if 'Heading' in paragraph.pstyle:
            print(f'Heading: {paragraph.text}')

# Get formatted data
for paragraph in document.paragraphs:
    for run in paragraph.parts:
        if run.bold:
            print(f'Bold text: {run.text}')
```

### Working with Tables

```python
for table in document.tables:
    # Display table structure
    print(table.show)  
    
    # Get all table text
    print(table.text)
    
    # Access cells by position
    cell = table.parts[0].parts[0]
    print(f'First cell: {cell.text}')
```
