ChessPerfCalc displays numerical performance indicators from the game results supplied in a text file for the players who played in the games.


Run 'python -m pip show chesscalc' at a command line to display version and dependency (requires and required-by) information.

Version numbers for the packages listed under 'requires' are given in the setup.py file.

Run 'python -m pip check' at a command line to display discrepancies between required and installed versions of packages.

'python' may need to be replaced by <path to>python<version> depending on the system configuration: 'python3.8' for example.

ChessPerfCalc uses features introduced at Python3.2.

Python3.2, or later versions when available, must be installed to run ChessPerfCalc.

tkinter, part of Python, must be installed to run ChessPerfCalc.  Sometimes this is installed separately.
