Dear Hiring Manager,

Dear Discord Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer position on Discord's Data Platform team. With over 4 years of experience in building scalable, high-performance applications and a strong background in distributed systems, I am confident I can contribute meaningfully to Discord's mission of bringing people together.

In my current role as a Full Stack Developer at Doublene, I have architected and developed enterprise-grade Java applications serving over 20,000 concurrent users, designed microservices architectures using Spring Cloud, and engineered real-time data processing pipelines with Apache Kafka - directly aligning with Discord's requirements for large-scale distributed systems and modern data technologies.

My experience includes:
• Building real-time data processing pipelines using Apache Kafka and event-driven architectures
• Implementing centralized logging and monitoring solutions using the ELK stack
• Optimizing database performance through efficient indexing strategies and query optimization
• Working with distributed systems, caching layers (Redis), and cloud technologies

What particularly excites me about Discord is the platform's incredible scale and the opportunity to work on bleeding-edge data infrastructure that enables millions of users to connect and communicate. I'm passionate about building systems that can handle massive scale while maintaining reliability and performance.

My technical expertise in Java, distributed systems, and data platforms, combined with my proven track record of delivering high-quality solutions, makes me well-suited to contribute to Discord's data platform evolution. I'm eager to bring my experience with modern data technologies and distributed systems to help Discord continue scaling its platform.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to Discord's continued growth and success.

Best regards,
Saitarun Movva

Sincerely,
Saitarun Movva
