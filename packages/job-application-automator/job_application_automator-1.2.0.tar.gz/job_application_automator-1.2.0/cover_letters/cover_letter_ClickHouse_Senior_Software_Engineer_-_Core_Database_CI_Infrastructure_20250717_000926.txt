Dear Hiring Manager,

Dear ClickHouse Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer - Core Database CI Infrastructure position at ClickHouse. With over 4 years of experience in high-performance systems development and a proven track record of optimizing database infrastructures, I am confident I can contribute significantly to your team's mission of scaling and growing ClickHouse's open-source and cloud offerings.

My expertise directly aligns with your technical requirements. At TECHECY, I architected and developed a high-performance, fault-tolerant distributed storage system using C++17, leveraging advanced libraries like ZeroMQ for inter-process communication and RocksDB for persistent storage. This experience has given me deep knowledge of performance engineering, production debugging, and the problem-solving skills essential for database infrastructure work.

In my current role at Doublene, I've designed and implemented scalable microservices architectures serving over 20,000 concurrent users, optimized database performance through efficient indexing strategies resulting in 30% reduction in query execution times, and collaborated closely with DevOps teams to streamline CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. My experience with distributed caching layers, real-time data processing pipelines using Apache Kafka, and comprehensive monitoring systems using Prometheus and Grafana demonstrates my capability to handle the scale and complexity of ClickHouse's infrastructure.

What particularly excites me about this opportunity is the chance to work with ClickHouse's cutting-edge OLAP database technology and contribute to the development of scalable, fault-tolerant CI systems that support your global, remote-first team. My background in optimizing high-performance systems, combined with my experience in database sharding, query optimization, and distributed systems architecture, positions me well to help enhance ClickHouse's core database CI infrastructure.

I am authorized to work in the United Kingdom and do not require sponsorship. I am eager to bring my technical expertise, collaborative mindset, and passion for performance optimization to the ClickHouse team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my experience can contribute to ClickHouse's continued success.

Best regards,
Saitarun Movva

Sincerely,
Saitarun Movva
