Dear Hiring Manager,

Dear Discord Engineering Team,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer, Data Platform position at Discord. As a software engineer with extensive experience in large-scale distributed systems and data infrastructure, I am thrilled at the opportunity to contribute to Discord's mission of creating spaces for communities to connect and communicate.

In my current role at Doublene, I have architected and developed enterprise-grade Java applications serving over 20,000 concurrent users, with a focus on real-time data processing using Apache Kafka - directly relevant to Discord's massive scale of real-time messaging and communication. My experience includes designing scalable microservices architectures and implementing efficient data pipelines that handle high-throughput, low-latency requirements.

My technical expertise perfectly aligns with Discord's needs:
- **Distributed Systems**: Built fault-tolerant systems using microservices architecture with Spring Cloud
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Implemented Apache Kafka pipelines for event-driven architectures
- **High-Scale Performance**: Optimized systems serving 20,000+ concurrent users with 40% response time improvements
- **Modern Data Stack**: Experience with Flink, Spark, and various data orchestration tools
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Extensive experience with AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes

During my previous role at TECHECY, I developed a high-performance distributed storage system using C++17, implementing advanced techniques for zero-copy buffer management and asynchronous I/O operations. This experience with low-level optimization and high-frequency data processing would be valuable for Discord's real-time messaging infrastructure.

I am particularly drawn to Discord's unique position in enabling communities to thrive through technology. Having used Discord personally and witnessed its impact on gaming communities, developer communities, and beyond, I understand the importance of reliable, scalable infrastructure that can handle millions of concurrent users while maintaining the seamless experience that makes Discord special.

I would love to discuss how my experience with distributed systems, real-time data processing, and performance optimization can contribute to Discord's data platform team.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Saitarun Movva

Sincerely,
Saitarun Movva
