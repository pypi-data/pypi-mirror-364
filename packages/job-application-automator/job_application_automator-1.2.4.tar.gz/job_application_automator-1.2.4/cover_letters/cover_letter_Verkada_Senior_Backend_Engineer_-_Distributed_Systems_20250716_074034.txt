Dear Hiring Manager,

Dear Verkada Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Backend Engineer - Distributed Systems position at Verkada. With my extensive experience in building scalable distributed systems and my passion for security technology, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Verkada's mission of transforming the physical security industry.

My background aligns perfectly with Verkada's technical requirements:

**Distributed Systems Expertise**: In my current role at Doublene, I have designed and implemented highly scalable microservices architecture using Spring Cloud, serving over 20,000 concurrent users. I have hands-on experience with Redis, PostgreSQL, and MySQL - technologies that are central to Verkada's stack.

**Backend Engineering**: I have 4+ years of experience in backend development, with deep expertise in Java, Python, and Go. My work includes building fault-tolerant systems, implementing efficient database indexing strategies, and optimizing performance at scale.

**High-Concurrency Systems**: I have successfully architected key-value storage systems and microservices that handle high-concurrency workloads. My experience with Apache Kafka for real-time data processing and Redis for caching demonstrates my ability to build systems that can handle the demands of Verkada's growing platform.

**Leadership and Mentorship**: I have experience mentoring junior engineers and leading technical initiatives, which aligns with Verkada's collaborative engineering culture.

What excites me most about Verkada is the opportunity to work on technology that directly impacts physical security and helps protect people and property. The challenge of building distributed systems that can reliably handle security-critical workloads while maintaining high performance and scalability is exactly the kind of problem I'm passionate about solving.

I am excited about the possibility of relocating to San Mateo and contributing to Verkada's innovative approach to security technology. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical skills and experience can help Verkada continue to scale and innovate.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Saitarun Movva
