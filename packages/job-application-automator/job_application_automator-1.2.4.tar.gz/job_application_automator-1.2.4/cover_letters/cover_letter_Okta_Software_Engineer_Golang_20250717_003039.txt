Dear Hiring Manager,

Dear Okta Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer (Golang) position at Okta. With my strong background in backend development, distributed systems, and authorization technologies, I am eager to contribute to Okta's mission of secure identity and access management.

My professional experience aligns well with Okta's technical requirements. At Doublene, I have architected and developed enterprise-grade Java applications serving over 20,000 concurrent users, implementing scalable microservices architecture with Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Apache Kafka. This experience has given me deep insights into building secure, scalable backend systems that are essential for identity and access management platforms.

My technical expertise directly addresses the core requirements of this role:
- 4+ years of professional backend software development experience with expertise in distributed systems
- Strong understanding of performance optimization, having reduced database response times by 40% and query execution times by 30%
- Extensive experience with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and containerization technologies (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Deep knowledge of authentication and authorization systems through my work with OAuth2.0, JWT tokens, and secure user authentication
- Experience with microservices architecture and event-driven systems using Apache Kafka

While my primary experience is in Java and C++, I am enthusiastic about working with Go and have been actively learning the language. My strong foundation in backend development, combined with my experience in concurrent programming and distributed systems, positions me well to quickly adapt to Go's paradigms and contribute effectively to Okta's engineering team.

My experience building real-time data processing pipelines and implementing comprehensive monitoring solutions using Prometheus and Grafana aligns with Okta's need for reliable, observable systems. Additionally, my involvement in CI/CD pipeline optimization and my experience mentoring junior developers demonstrate my commitment to engineering excellence and team growth.

I am particularly drawn to Okta's focus on security, scalability, and the opportunity to work on systems that protect millions of users' identities. Your commitment to innovation in the identity space and fostering a culture of continuous learning resonates with my professional values and career aspirations.

The opportunity to work in Toronto with Okta's talented engineering team while contributing to cutting-edge identity and access management solutions is incredibly exciting. I am confident that my backend development expertise, performance optimization skills, and passion for secure systems would make me a valuable addition to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my technical skills and enthusiasm for Go development can contribute to Okta's continued success.

Best regards,
Saitarun Movva

Sincerely,
Saitarun Movva
