Dear Hiring Manager,

Dear ClickHouse Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Engineer - Core Database CI Infrastructure position at ClickHouse. With my extensive experience in C++, high-performance systems, and database optimization, I am excited to contribute to ClickHouse's innovative open-source column-oriented database system.

In my current role as a Full Stack Developer at Doublene, I have architected and developed enterprise-grade applications serving over 20,000 concurrent users, with a focus on performance optimization and scalability. My experience includes designing efficient indexing strategies and database sharding, resulting in a 30% reduction in query execution times - directly relevant to ClickHouse's performance-critical environment.

During my tenure as a C++ Developer at TECHECY, I developed a high-performance, fault-tolerant distributed storage system using C++17, leveraging advanced techniques like zero-copy buffer management and asynchronous I/O operations. This experience, combined with my proficiency in performance engineering and production debugging, aligns perfectly with ClickHouse's requirements for optimizing core database infrastructure.

My technical expertise includes:
- Advanced C++ programming with focus on performance optimization
- Experience with distributed systems and fault-tolerant architectures
- Strong background in database systems and query optimization
- Proficiency in CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes
- Experience with monitoring systems using Prometheus and Grafana

I am particularly drawn to ClickHouse's commitment to open-source innovation and the opportunity to work with a global, remote-first team. My academic background with a Master's in Software Engineering Systems from Northeastern University, combined with my practical experience in building scalable systems, positions me well to contribute to ClickHouse's continued growth.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in high-performance C++ development and database optimization can contribute to ClickHouse's core infrastructure team.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Saitarun Movva
