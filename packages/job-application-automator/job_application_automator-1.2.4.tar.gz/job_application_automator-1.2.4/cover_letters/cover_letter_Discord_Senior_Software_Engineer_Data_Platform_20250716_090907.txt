Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Engineer, Data Platform position at Discord. With over 4 years of experience in software engineering and a proven track record of building scalable data platforms, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Discord's mission of creating spaces for people to find belonging.

In my current role as a Full Stack Developer at Doublene, I have architected and developed enterprise-grade Java applications using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Apache Kafka, serving over 20,000 concurrent users. I have extensive experience with the exact technologies mentioned in your job posting, including Apache Kafka for real-time data processing pipelines, and have implemented comprehensive logging and monitoring solutions using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana).

My experience directly aligns with Discord's needs for large-scale distributed systems. I have designed and implemented scalable microservices architectures, optimized database performance achieving 30% reduction in query execution times, and worked with both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. Additionally, my background includes building high-performance distributed storage systems using C++, implementing caching layers with Redis, and working with modern data technologies like Apache Flink.

What excites me most about Discord is the platform's role in fostering communities and connections. I am particularly drawn to the challenge of scaling data infrastructure to support millions of users while maintaining the real-time, interactive experience that makes Discord special. My experience with event-driven architectures and real-time data processing would allow me to contribute immediately to Discord's data platform initiatives.

I am currently located in Boston, MA and am willing to relocate to the Bay Area for this position. I am authorized to work in the United States and am excited about the opportunity to bring my technical expertise and passion for building scalable systems to Discord's innovative team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my experience with distributed systems, data platforms, and real-time processing can contribute to Discord's continued success.

Sincerely,
Saitarun Movva
