Dear Hiring Manager,

Dear Verkada Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Backend Engineer position focusing on Distributed Systems at Verkada. With my extensive experience in building scalable distributed systems and expertise in Python, Go, and high-performance architectures, I am eager to contribute to Verkada's innovative security solutions.

In my current role as a Full Stack Developer at Doublene, I have designed and implemented microservices architectures serving over 20,000 concurrent users, utilizing technologies that directly align with Verkada's requirements. My experience with distributed systems, database optimization, and building fault-tolerant systems makes me well-suited for this role.

My relevant experience includes:
• Architecting scalable microservices architecture using Spring Cloud for service discovery and circuit breaker patterns
• Implementing high-concurrency key-value storage systems and distributed caching layers with Redis
• Working with both relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and optimizing database performance through efficient indexing
• Building real-time data processing pipelines and event-driven architectures
• Collaborating with DevOps teams to streamline CI/CD pipelines using Docker and Kubernetes
• Mentoring junior engineers and providing technical leadership in system design

What particularly excites me about Verkada is the opportunity to work on cutting-edge security technology that makes a real impact on physical security and safety. Your focus on building highly available, large-scale systems to support innovative security products aligns perfectly with my passion for distributed systems engineering.

My proficiency in server programming languages, experience with distributed systems, and proven track record of building scalable architectures make me confident that I can contribute meaningfully to Verkada's backend infrastructure. I'm particularly interested in the challenge of designing systems that can handle the scale and reliability requirements of modern security platforms.

I am prepared to relocate to the San Mateo area and am excited about the opportunity to work onsite with Verkada's talented engineering team. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Saitarun Movva

Sincerely,
Saitarun Movva
