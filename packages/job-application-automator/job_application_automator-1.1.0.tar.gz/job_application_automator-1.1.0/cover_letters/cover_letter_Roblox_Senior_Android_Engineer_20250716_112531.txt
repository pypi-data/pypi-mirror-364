Dear Hiring Manager,

Dear Roblox Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Android Engineer position at Roblox. As a software engineer with extensive experience in mobile development, high-performance systems, and scalable architectures, I am thrilled by the opportunity to contribute to a platform that empowers millions of users to create, play, and connect through immersive experiences.

While my primary expertise lies in Java, C++, and full-stack development, I have significant experience with mobile application development and the underlying systems that power them. My current role at Doublene involves building applications that serve over 20,000 concurrent users, requiring the same attention to performance, reliability, and user experience that's crucial for Android development at Roblox's scale.

Key qualifications that make me a strong fit for this role:

**Mobile & Client Development Experience:**
- Developed Qt-based applications with real-time user interfaces and low-latency interactions
- Built responsive, high-performance client applications with focus on user experience
- Experience with real-time communication systems using WebSockets and event-driven architectures

**Performance & Scalability:**
- Optimized systems for 40% performance improvements and 30% query time reductions
- Implemented caching layers and memory optimization techniques
- Built distributed systems handling high-frequency, real-time data processing

**Technical Leadership:**
- Mentored junior developers and conducted code reviews
- Designed scalable architectures for enterprise-grade applications
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality products

**Problem-Solving & Innovation:**
- Ranked #1 in Advanced OOP using C++ at Northeastern University
- Consistently achieved top rankings in competitive programming (LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks)
- Strong foundation in algorithms and data structures

I am particularly drawn to Roblox's mission of enabling human connection through play and creation. The technical challenges of building mobile experiences that can handle millions of concurrent users while maintaining smooth gameplay and social interactions align perfectly with my passion for high-performance systems and user-centric design.

My experience with real-time systems, performance optimization, and scalable architectures, combined with my strong programming fundamentals and collaborative approach, would enable me to contribute effectively to Roblox's Android team while continuing to grow my mobile development expertise.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to Roblox's continued success.

Best regards,
Saitarun Movva

Sincerely,
Saitarun Movva
