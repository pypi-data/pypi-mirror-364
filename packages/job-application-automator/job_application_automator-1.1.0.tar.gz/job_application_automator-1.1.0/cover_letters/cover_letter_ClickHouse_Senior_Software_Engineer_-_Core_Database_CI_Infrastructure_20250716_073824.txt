I am excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer - Core Database CI Infrastructure position at ClickHouse. As a passionate developer with deep expertise in C++ and distributed systems, I am thrilled about the opportunity to contribute to the world's leading open-source column-oriented database system.

My technical background aligns perfectly with ClickHouse's requirements:

**C++ Expertise**: During my tenure at TECHECY, I architected and developed high-performance distributed storage systems using C++17, leveraging advanced techniques including zero-copy buffer management and asynchronous I/O operations with Boost.Asio library, achieving 40% reduction in network latency.

**Performance Engineering**: I have extensive experience optimizing systems for high-performance scenarios, including developing custom memory allocators using jemalloc that improved memory utilization by 25% and implementing distributed caching layers that enhanced response times by 60%.

**CI/CD and Infrastructure**: I have hands-on experience with Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes, and have collaborated closely with DevOps teams to streamline CI/CD pipelines. My work includes implementing comprehensive monitoring solutions using Prometheus and Grafana.

**Distributed Systems**: I've designed fault-tolerant distributed systems with ZeroMQ for inter-process communication and RocksDB for persistent storage, demonstrating my ability to work with the technologies that power ClickHouse's infrastructure.

What excites me most about ClickHouse is the opportunity to work on cutting-edge database technology that handles massive scale while maintaining exceptional performance. I am particularly drawn to the challenge of building robust CI infrastructure that ensures reliability and scalability of the core database system.

I am eager to contribute to ClickHouse's mission of making analytics accessible and efficient for organizations worldwide.
