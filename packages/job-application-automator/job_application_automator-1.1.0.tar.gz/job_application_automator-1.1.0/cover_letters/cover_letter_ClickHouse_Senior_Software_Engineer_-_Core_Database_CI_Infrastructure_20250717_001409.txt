Dear Hiring Manager,

Dear ClickHouse Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Engineer - Core Database CI Infrastructure position at ClickHouse. With my extensive experience in C++ development, distributed systems, and CI/CD infrastructure, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your cutting-edge open-source column-oriented database system.

In my current role as a Full Stack Developer at Doublene, I have architected and developed enterprise-grade applications serving over 20,000 concurrent users, with a focus on scalable microservices architecture, real-time data processing pipelines using Apache Kafka, and comprehensive monitoring solutions using the ELK stack. My experience with database optimization, including efficient indexing strategies and query optimization, has resulted in 30% reduction in query execution times.

My previous experience as a C++ Developer at TECHECY particularly aligns with ClickHouse's technical requirements. I architected and developed a high-performance, fault-tolerant distributed storage system using C++17, leveraging advanced techniques such as zero-copy buffer management and asynchronous I/O operations. I implemented comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems using Prometheus and Grafana, which directly relates to the CI infrastructure monitoring needs at ClickHouse.

Key technical accomplishments that make me a strong fit for this role include:
- Deep expertise in C++ and Unix/Linux systems, with experience in performance engineering and production debugging
- Hands-on experience with distributed systems, caching layers, and network programming
- Strong background in CI/CD pipeline automation using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes
- Experience with monitoring and observability tools including Prometheus, Grafana, and comprehensive logging solutions

I am particularly drawn to ClickHouse's commitment to open-source innovation and the opportunity to work with a globally distributed team on solving complex technical challenges in the database domain. Your company's focus on building scalable, high-performance systems aligns perfectly with my technical expertise and career aspirations.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in building robust, scalable systems can contribute to ClickHouse's continued success. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Saitarun Movva

Sincerely,
Saitarun Movva
