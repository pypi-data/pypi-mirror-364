Dear Hiring Manager,

Dear Okta Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer (Golang) position at Okta. As a backend engineer with extensive experience in distributed systems and a strong interest in identity and access management, I am thrilled about the opportunity to contribute to Okta's mission of enabling secure digital transformation.

My technical background aligns well with Okta's requirements:

**Backend Development Excellence**: With 4+ years of professional software engineering experience, I have built and maintained high-performance backend systems. In my current role at Doublene, I architect and develop Java applications using Spring Boot and microservices, serving over 20,000 concurrent users.

**Distributed Systems Expertise**: I have deep experience with distributed systems architecture, including implementing fault-tolerant microservices with Spring Cloud, real-time data processing with Apache Kafka, and distributed caching with Redis. My work has consistently focused on building systems that can handle high throughput and low latency requirements.

**Performance Optimization**: I have a proven track record of optimizing system performance, including reducing query execution times by 30% through efficient database indexing and decreasing response times by 40% through strategic caching implementations.

**Cloud and DevOps**: I have hands-on experience with AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes, and have collaborated closely with DevOps teams to streamline CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins. This experience would be valuable in Okta's cloud-first environment.

**Problem-Solving and Leadership**: I have experience mentoring junior engineers, conducting code reviews, and leading technical initiatives - skills that align with Okta's collaborative engineering culture.

While my primary experience is in Java, I am eager to apply my distributed systems knowledge to Go development. My strong foundation in concurrent programming, system design, and performance optimization provides an excellent base for transitioning to Go, and I am excited about the opportunity to work with Okta's Go-based authorization systems.

What attracts me most to Okta is the opportunity to work on technology that directly impacts digital security and helps organizations protect their most valuable assets. The challenge of building authorization systems that must be both highly secure and performant at massive scale is exactly the kind of problem I'm passionate about solving.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my backend engineering experience and passion for distributed systems can contribute to Okta's continued innovation in identity and access management.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Saitarun Movva

Sincerely,
Saitarun Movva
