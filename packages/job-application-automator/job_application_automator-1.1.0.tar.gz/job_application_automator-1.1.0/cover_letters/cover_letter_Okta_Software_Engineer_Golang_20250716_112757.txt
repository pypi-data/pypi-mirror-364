Dear Hiring Manager,

Dear Okta Engineering Team,

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer (Golang) position at Okta. With my extensive experience in backend development, distributed systems, and high-performance applications, I am eager to contribute to Okta's mission of enabling secure identity management for organizations worldwide.

While my primary expertise is in Java and C++, I have strong foundational knowledge in systems programming that translates directly to Go development. My experience building scalable, high-performance backend systems aligns perfectly with Okta's requirements for robust authorization and identity management infrastructure.

**Backend Development & Distributed Systems:**
- Architected and developed enterprise-grade applications serving 20,000+ concurrent users
- Built high-performance distributed storage systems with fault tolerance and scalability
- Implemented microservices architectures with service discovery and load balancing
- Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) and container orchestration

**Performance Engineering:**
- Optimized systems for 40% performance improvements and 30% query time reductions
- Implemented advanced caching strategies using Redis and Memcached
- Designed efficient database indexing and query optimization techniques
- Experience with low-latency, high-throughput system design

**Security & Authorization:**
- Built secure authentication and authorization systems
- Implemented comprehensive monitoring and alerting for security incident detection
- Experience with OAuth2.0 and JWT token management
- Strong understanding of security best practices and compliance requirements

**Technical Leadership:**
- Mentored junior developers and conducted thorough code reviews
- Led design discussions for scalable system architectures
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver reliable solutions
- Proven track record in production debugging and performance optimization

I am particularly drawn to Okta's role in securing the modern enterprise through identity management. The challenges of building authorization systems that can handle millions of authentication requests while maintaining security and performance standards align perfectly with my experience in high-scale backend development.

My strong programming fundamentals, experience with distributed systems, and passion for building secure, scalable infrastructure make me well-positioned to contribute to Okta's Go-based backend services. I am eager to apply my expertise in performance optimization and system design to help strengthen Okta's identity platform.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my backend development expertise can contribute to Okta's continued innovation in identity security.

Best regards,
Saitarun Movva
