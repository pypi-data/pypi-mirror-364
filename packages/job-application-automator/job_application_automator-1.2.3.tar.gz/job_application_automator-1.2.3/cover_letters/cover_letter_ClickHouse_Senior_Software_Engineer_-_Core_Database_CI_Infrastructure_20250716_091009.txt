Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Engineer - Core Database CI Infrastructure position at ClickHouse. With over 4 years of experience in software engineering and a specialized focus on high-performance systems, distributed databases, and CI/CD infrastructure, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to ClickHouse's innovative open-source column-oriented database system.

My technical background aligns perfectly with ClickHouse's requirements. I have extensive experience with C++ development, having architected and developed high-performance, fault-tolerant distributed storage systems using C++17 in my previous role at TECHECY. I leveraged advanced techniques including zero-copy buffer management, asynchronous I/O operations using Boost.Asio, and implemented custom memory allocators, achieving significant performance improvements including 40% reduction in network latency and 25% improvement in memory utilization.

My experience in performance engineering and production debugging makes me well-suited for this role. I have optimized database performance through efficient indexing strategies, query optimization techniques, and database sharding, resulting in 30% reduction in query execution times. I have also worked extensively with Unix systems, implementing comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems using Prometheus and Grafana, providing real-time insights into system health and performance.

In my current role at Doublene, I have designed and implemented scalable microservices architectures, worked with distributed databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), and have experience with cloud infrastructure including Kubernetes orchestration. I have collaborated closely with DevOps teams to streamline CI/CD pipelines, automating build, testing, and deployment processes using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes - directly relevant to the CI Infrastructure focus of this role.

What excites me most about ClickHouse is the opportunity to work on cutting-edge database technology that handles massive-scale data processing. I am particularly drawn to the challenge of building and maintaining core database CI infrastructure that ensures the reliability and performance of such a critical system. My experience with high-performance systems, combined with my passion for open-source technologies, makes me enthusiastic about contributing to ClickHouse's continued growth and innovation.

I am currently based in the United States but am open to remote work arrangements. I have experience working with globally distributed teams and am comfortable collaborating across different time zones.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my expertise in C++, performance engineering, and distributed systems can contribute to ClickHouse's CI infrastructure and overall success.

Sincerely,
Saitarun Movva
