Dear Hiring Manager,

Dear ClickHouse Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer - Core Database CI Infrastructure position at ClickHouse. As a Boston-based software engineer with deep expertise in C++ development and distributed systems, I am eager to contribute to ClickHouse's innovative database technology from within the United States.

My professional journey has been defined by building high-performance, scalable systems that serve thousands of concurrent users. At Doublene, I architected enterprise-grade Java applications serving over 20,000 concurrent users, implementing microservices architecture with Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Apache Kafka. This experience has given me a strong foundation in building robust, production-ready systems that directly translates to database infrastructure work.

My C++ expertise, developed during my tenure at TECHECY, is particularly relevant to this role. I designed and implemented a high-performance, fault-tolerant distributed storage system using C++17, leveraging advanced libraries like ZeroMQ for inter-process communication and RocksDB for persistent storage. I also optimized network communication using zero-copy buffer management and asynchronous I/O operations, reducing network latency by 40% - the kind of performance optimization that's crucial for database CI infrastructure.

What makes me particularly well-suited for this position:
- 4+ years of professional C++ development with expertise in performance engineering and production debugging
- Extensive experience with CI/CD pipeline automation using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes
- Strong background in distributed systems, having built scalable client-server architectures
- Proven track record in performance optimization, reducing query execution times by 30% and improving memory utilization by 25%
- Experience with monitoring and alerting systems using Prometheus and Grafana

Being based in Boston, I can contribute effectively to ClickHouse's global, remote-first team while operating within US time zones. I am authorized to work in the United States and do not require sponsorship.

I am particularly drawn to ClickHouse's commitment to open-source innovation and the opportunity to work on cutting-edge database technology. Your focus on performance and scalability aligns perfectly with my technical expertise and career goals.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my technical skills and passion for high-performance systems can contribute to ClickHouse's continued success.

Best regards,
Saitarun Movva

Sincerely,
Saitarun Movva
