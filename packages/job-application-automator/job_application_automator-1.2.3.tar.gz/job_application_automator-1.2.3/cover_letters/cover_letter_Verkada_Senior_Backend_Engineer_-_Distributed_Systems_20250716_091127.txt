Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Backend Engineer - Distributed Systems position at Verkada. With over 4 years of experience in software engineering and a specialized focus on distributed systems, microservices architecture, and high-performance backend development, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Verkada's innovative cloud-based security platform.

My technical expertise aligns perfectly with Verkada's requirements for this role. I have extensive experience with Python and Go programming languages, which are key technologies mentioned in the job posting. In my current role at Doublene, I have designed and implemented scalable microservices architectures, working with distributed databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Redis. I have experience with the exact technologies Verkada uses, including Redis for caching and high-performance key-value storage, and DynamoDB for distributed database operations.

My experience in building high-concurrency systems directly matches what Verkada is seeking. I have architected and developed enterprise-grade Java applications serving over 20,000 concurrent users, and in my previous role at TECHECY, I built high-performance, fault-tolerant distributed storage systems using C++17. I have implemented scalable client-server architectures, optimized for horizontal scaling and failover capabilities, and achieved significant performance improvements including 40% reduction in network latency and 60% improvement in response times through distributed caching.

What particularly excites me about Verkada is the company's mission to provide comprehensive security solutions through innovative cloud-based technology. I am drawn to the challenge of building and maintaining the backend infrastructure that powers Verkada's security cameras, access control systems, and analytics platforms. My experience with real-time data processing, event-driven architectures, and distributed systems would allow me to contribute immediately to Verkada's mission of making security more accessible and effective.

I have extensive experience with microservices architecture patterns, having implemented service discovery, load balancing, and circuit breaker patterns using Spring Cloud. My background also includes working with containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, which are essential for scalable distributed systems. I am passionate about performance optimization and have consistently delivered systems with improved reliability and reduced latency.

I am currently located in Boston, MA and am willing to relocate to the San Mateo area to work onsite as required for this role. I am excited about the opportunity to join Verkada's team and contribute to building the next generation of cloud-based security solutions.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my expertise in distributed systems, microservices architecture, and high-performance backend development can contribute to Verkada's continued innovation and success.

Sincerely,
Saitarun Movva
