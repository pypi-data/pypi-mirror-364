Dear Hiring Manager,

Dear ClickHouse Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Engineer - Core Database CI Infrastructure position at ClickHouse (Germany remote). As a software engineer with extensive experience in C++ development and distributed systems, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to ClickHouse's innovative database technology while working with your European team.

My professional experience aligns perfectly with ClickHouse's technical requirements. At Doublene, I have successfully architected and developed enterprise-grade applications serving over 20,000 concurrent users, implementing scalable microservices architecture using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Apache Kafka. This experience has provided me with deep insights into building robust, production-ready systems that are essential for database infrastructure.

My C++ expertise, developed during my tenure at TECHECY, directly addresses the core requirements of this role. I designed and implemented a high-performance, fault-tolerant distributed storage system using C++17, leveraging advanced libraries such as ZeroMQ for inter-process communication and RocksDB for persistent storage. I also implemented comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems using Prometheus and Grafana, which are crucial for CI infrastructure management.

Key qualifications that make me an ideal candidate:
- 4+ years of professional C++ development with deep expertise in C++17 and performance optimization
- Extensive experience with CI/CD pipeline automation using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes
- Strong background in distributed systems architecture and fault-tolerant design
- Proven track record of performance improvements: 40% reduction in network latency and 25% improvement in memory utilization
- Experience with Unix systems, production debugging, and performance engineering

I am particularly drawn to ClickHouse's commitment to open-source innovation and the opportunity to work with a global, remote-first team. Your focus on performance, scalability, and cutting-edge database technology aligns perfectly with my technical expertise and career aspirations.

Working remotely from the US while collaborating with the European team presents an exciting opportunity to contribute to ClickHouse's global success. I am comfortable working across time zones and have experience collaborating with distributed teams.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical skills, performance optimization expertise, and passion for high-performance systems can contribute to ClickHouse's continued innovation in the database space.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Saitarun Movva

Sincerely,
Saitarun Movva
