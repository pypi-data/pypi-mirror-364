This addon creates new groups in Purchase.

Visibility of purchase orders is restricted for users in these groups.
You can only see the purchase order:

- User (own orders): If you are a follower of the partner or there is no
  user or you are the partner's user.
- User (team orders): If you are a follower of the partner or there is
  no user or you are a user of your purchasing team.
