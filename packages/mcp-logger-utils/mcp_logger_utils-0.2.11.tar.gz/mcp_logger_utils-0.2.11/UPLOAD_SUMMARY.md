# mcp-logger-utils Upload Summary

## Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed .pth file issue**: The editable install had created an empty .pth file, preventing imports
2. **Fixed logger issues**: 
   - json_utils.py was using a logger without tool_name binding, causing KeyError
   - Created a default logger without binding to avoid format string issues
3. **Fixed test issues**:
   - Updated response_utils test calls to use correct parameter names
   - Fixed debug_tools test to use actual MCPDebugTools methods
4. **Fixed pyproject.toml**:
   - Removed twine from runtime dependencies (moved to dev only)
   - Updated GitHub URLs to use correct username
   - Added __version__ to __init__.py

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ MCPLogger: Working correctly with truncation, logging levels
- ✅ debug_tool decorator: Both sync and async functions work
- ✅ JSON utilities: repair_and_parse_json handles invalid JSON
- ✅ Response utilities: Standardized response format working
- ✅ Debug tools: Process management for MCP servers
- ✅ File operations: Log files created correctly
