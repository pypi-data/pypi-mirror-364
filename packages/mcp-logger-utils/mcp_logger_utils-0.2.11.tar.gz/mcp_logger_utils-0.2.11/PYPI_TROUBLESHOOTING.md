Absolutely! Here's an updated version of your README that includes a painful but realistic summary of what‚Äôs required to get PyPI to accept package updates in 2025‚Äîincluding all the relevant tips and setup you learned the hard way:

# MCP Logger Utils

A robust, shared logging and utility package for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, especially tailored for Claude Code environments.

## üíÄ Publishing to PyPI (a journey through pain and bureaucracy)

Getting this package onto PyPI the first time was mildly annoying. Releasing updates with modern tooling is... deeply irritating. Here's everything you need to save hours of lostness:

### ‚úÖ Step-by-step guide to PyPI uploads in 2025

1. **Ensure `pyproject.toml` is correctly configured**
   - Use `hatchling` as your build backend.
   - Only define the version once (either in `pyproject.toml` or your Python module via `tool.hatch.version.path`).
   - Example: see the `pyproject.toml` in this project (yes, it matters that you copy structuring perfectly).

2. **Use `python -m build` (not `setup.py`)**
   ```
   python -m pip install build
   python -m build
   ```

3. **Install Twine and upload**
   ```
   python -m pip install twine
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

4. **Authentication with Twine**:
   - Use PyPI **API Tokens**, not your username/password.
   - Your `~/.pypirc` should look like this:

     ```
     [distutils]
     index-servers =
         pypi

     [pypi]
     username = __token__
     password = pypi-
     ```

   - Or pass it manually (not secure, not recommended):
     ```
     twine upload -u __token__ -p pypi-xxx dist/*
     ```

5. **Token must match the project name exactly** if scoped.

6. **PyPI will reject any re-uploads of the same version**  
   - Always bump the version in `pyproject.toml` or your `__init__.py`.
   - If you don‚Äôt, you get:
     ```
     403: File already exists
     ```

7. **The `[tool.hatch.build.targets]` section must be properly declared**  
   Don't do this:
   ```
   targets = ["sdist", "wheel"]  # ‚ùå will fail
   ```
   Do this instead:
   ```
   [tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]
   [tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
   ```

8. **You can automate this process**  
   See GitHub Actions example in `.github/workflows/release.yml` (not yet committed here).

## Features

- **Isolated Logging:** Prevents conflicts with other libraries using `loguru`.
- **Automatic Truncation:** Shortens large strings, base64 data, long embeddings, and more.
- **Universal Decorator:** `@debug_tool` works with `async` and regular `def` functions.
- **Safe Serialization:** Handles non-serializables like `datetime` and `Path`.
- **Robust JSON Repair:** Fixes syntactically broken or dirty JSON responses from LLMs.
- **Consistent Response Format:** Helps all tools return structured output and errors with metadata.

## Installation

```
pip install mcp-logger-utils
```

Or with `uv`:

```
uv pip install mcp-logger-utils
```

---

## Usage

_Usage examples omitted here, but they remain the same and reference amazing utilities like:_
- `@debug_tool`
- `repair_and_parse_json()`
- `create_success_response()`  
- ...and more general-use structured wrappers.
