# mcp-logger-utils Fixed and Deployed Successfully

## Summary of Issues and Fixes

### Initial Problem
- Package imports were failing with `ModuleNotFoundError`
- All MCP servers depending on this package were broken

### Root Causes Found
1. **Empty .pth file**: The editable install created an empty `.pth` file preventing imports
2. **Logger configuration issue**: json_utils was using an unbound logger causing KeyError
3. **Missing source files in wheel**: Version 0.2.10 wheel didn't include Python source files due to hatch configuration

### Fixes Applied

1. **Version 0.2.10** (partial fix):
   - Fixed logger binding issues in json_utils.py
   - Fixed test parameter mismatches
   - Removed twine from runtime dependencies
   - Updated GitHub URLs
   - Added __version__ to __init__.py

2. **Version 0.2.11** (complete fix):
   - Fixed hatch build configuration to include source files
   - Added proper wheel package configuration
   - Successfully uploaded to PyPI with all files included

## Final Status

âœ… **Package fully functional**
- Version 0.2.11 is live on PyPI
- All imports work correctly
- All functionality tested and verified
- Package can be installed with: `pip install mcp-logger-utils==0.2.11`

## Test Results
```bash
$ python -c "from mcp_logger_utils import MCPLogger; print('SUCCESS!')"
SUCCESS!
```

All dependent MCP servers should now work correctly after updating to version 0.2.11.
