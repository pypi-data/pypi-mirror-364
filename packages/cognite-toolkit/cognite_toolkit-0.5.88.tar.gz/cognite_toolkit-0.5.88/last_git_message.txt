[CDF-25018] âž¡ cdf migrate files (#1717)

# Description

**Context**: This is part of the alpha migration tooling in Toolkit, for
overview [see
here](https://cognitedata.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~170890702/pages/5455773697/Migration+Tooling+in+Toolkit).
This is step 3 of that process, enabling linking of asset-centric files
to cognite-files, such that the new CogniteFile can point to an existing
asset-centric file and thus not needing to download and reupload the
file content.

This PR adds the command for migrating files, meaning linking them to
the existing asset-centric FileMetadata.
