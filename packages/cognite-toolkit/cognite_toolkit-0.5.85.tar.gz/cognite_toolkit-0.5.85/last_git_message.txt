[CDF-25260] ðŸ¦‡  Dump agents (#1764)

# Description

Stacked on #1763

A common workflow is that the user creates a CDF resource using the
fusion UI in a CDF dev project. Then, they dump the resources down to
YAML configuration, which is checked into version control, and deployed
in a CI/CD to a CDF prod project.

This PR adds support for dumping agents.
