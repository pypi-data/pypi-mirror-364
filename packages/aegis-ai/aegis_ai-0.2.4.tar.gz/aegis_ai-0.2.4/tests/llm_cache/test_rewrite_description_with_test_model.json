    "explanation": "The original description was technically correct but lacked clarity on the attack vector and the attacker's position. The rewritten description explicitly states that a 'remote attacker' can use a 'specially crafted, gzip-compressed HTTP response' to initiate the attack. It also clarifies the causal link: the integer overflow occurs in the zlib library, which then leads to the buffer overflow in libcurl, providing a more precise and understandable narrative for analysts. The title was revised for conciseness while retaining the core components of the vulnerability.",

    "rewritten_description": "A flaw was found in libcurl. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to trigger a buffer overflow by sending a specially crafted, gzip-compressed HTTP response. This issue is caused by an integer overflow in the underlying zlib library during the decompression process."
