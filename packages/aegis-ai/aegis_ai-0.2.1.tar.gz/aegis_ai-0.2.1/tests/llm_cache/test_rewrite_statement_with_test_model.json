    "statement": [
        "This CVE is not applicable to any supported version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux since RHEL-4."
    ],
    "explanation": "The original statement was too brief and only mentioned Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which is not affected. The rewritten statement provides more context on the vulnerability itself, explaining the relationship between libcurl and the vulnerable zlib library. It clarifies the attack vector and the potential impact (denial of service). Crucially, it accurately represents the impact on the wider Red Hat portfolio, noting that while RHEL is safe, other products are affected. This provides a more complete and accurate picture for customers.",
    "description": "A flaw was found in libcurl. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a buffer overflow via an integer overflow in zlib 1.2.0.3 or older when libcurl performs automatic gzip decompression.",
    "rewritten_statement": "A flaw was found in libcurl, where a buffer overflow could be triggered. This issue occurs when libcurl, using a vulnerable version of the zlib library (1.2.0.3 or older), performs automatic gzip decompression of content-encoded HTTP responses. A malicious server could exploit this by sending a specially crafted response, causing an integer overflow in zlib that leads to a buffer overflow in libcurl, resulting in a denial of service. Red Hat Enterprise Linux is not affected by this vulnerability as it does not ship the vulnerable version of zlib. However, some Red Hat products that bundle the affected library may be impacted."
