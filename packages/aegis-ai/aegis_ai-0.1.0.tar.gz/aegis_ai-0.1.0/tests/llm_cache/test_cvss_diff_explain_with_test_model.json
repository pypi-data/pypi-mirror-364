    "statement": "This CVE is not applicable to any supported version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux since RHEL-4.",
    "explanation": "The CVSSv3 score provided by Red Hat for CVE-2025-0725 is 3.3, while the score from NVD is 7.3. The primary reason for this difference lies in the assessment of the 'Attack Vector' (AV) metric.\n\nRed Hat has assigned an AV of 'Local' (AV:L), which results in a lower base score. This is because Red Hat's analysis is specific to its products. In the context of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the vulnerable code is not in the execution path of the curl command, meaning a successful exploit would require some form of local user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.\n\nOn the other hand, NVD has assigned an AV of 'Network' (AV:N). This reflects a more general assessment of the vulnerability, where the most common use case is a client application (like curl) fetching data from a malicious server over a network. This scenario does not require any local access, hence the higher severity rating."
