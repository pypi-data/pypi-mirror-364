# Tempest and oslo.log are actually runtime requirements (obviously), so they
# should be in requirements.txt. However, in order to support deployments where
# Tempest is installed from RPM and might conflict with a pip installation of
# whitebox and Tempest, it was removed from requirements.txt. This means that
# it had to be added here, to make sure it got installed for any tox jobs (like
# unit tests and pep8) that don't have something like devstack installing
# Tempest beforehand. oslo.log is in the same boat.
