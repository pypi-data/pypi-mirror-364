from models.py import Departments, Managers

Departments.create_keyspace()
Managers.create_keyspace()

class Department(Schema):
    name: str
    employees: int

class Manager(Schema):
    name: str
    age: int

#***.py
from models.py import Departments, Managers, Department, Manager

department = Department(
    name="Sales",
    employees=10
).serialize()

manager = Manager(
    name="John Doe",
    age=46
).serialize()

#put into async function
res1 = await Departments.insert_custom_key_value(custom_key="Sales", value=department) 
#{'success': True, 'payload': 192893812831283134324}
res2 = await Managers.insert_value(value=manager)
#{'success': True, 'payload': 192893812831283134324}
res3 = await Departments.get_value(custom_key="Sales")
#{'success': True, 'payload': {'name': 'Sales', 'employees': 10}}
res4 = await Managers.lookup_values_where(age=46)
#{'success': True, 'payload': [{'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 46}]}
