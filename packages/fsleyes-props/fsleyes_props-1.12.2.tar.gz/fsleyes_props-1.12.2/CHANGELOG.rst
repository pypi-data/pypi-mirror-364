This document contains the ``fsleyes-props`` release history in reverse
chronological order.


1.12.2 (Wednesday 23rd July 2025)
---------------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed a bug in :meth:`.HasProperties.isBound`, which was always returning
  ``None``.


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Migrated to `setuptools-scm
  <https://setuptools-scm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for version number
  management.


1.12.0 (Friday 8th November 2024)
---------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* The :meth:`.Choice.setChoices` method now accepts a `newChoice` argument,
  allowing the new choice value to be set when the choices are updated.
* New `onUser` argument when creating a :class:`.Widget` for a `.Choice`
  property, which is called whenever the user interacts with the widget.


1.11.0 (Monday 18th September 2023)
-----------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* New ``prefix`` option for :class:`.ColourMap` properties - when a prefix is
  set, assignments to the property, e.g. ``obj.cmap = 'red'``, will cause a
  colour map named ``{prefix}_red`` to be chosen over a colour map named
  ``red``, if the former is registered with matplotlib.


Changed
^^^^^^^


* The :class:`.ColourMap` property no longer supports looking up colour maps
  by their name or registered key. This is because matplotlib 3.8 has made it
  impossible to give a colour map a name different to the key under which it
  registered.


1.10.0 (Tuesday 18th July 2023)
-------------------------------


Changed
^^^^^^^


* :class:`.Array` property types can now be set to ``None``.
* Replaced ``setup.py``-based build system with ``pyproject.toml``.


1.9.6 (Monday 10th July 2023)
-----------------------------


Changed
^^^^^^^


* The type-specific equality function is now used when the ``'default'``
  attribute value is changed, instead of a naive equality (``==``) comparison.
  This is primarily to allow the default value to be set to a ``numpy.array``
  (e.g. for the :class:`.Array` type), for which a naive equality test would
  result in an error.


1.9.5 (Thursday 6th July 2023)
------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* Added the ability to set the label shown alongside a checkbox bound to a
  :class:`.Boolean` property when creating a via :class:`.Widget`
  specification. The label can be specified with the ``cblabel`` argument.


1.9.4 (Thursday 6th July 2023)
------------------------------


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Adjusted the :func:`.buildGUI` function so that initial widget states (as determined
  by ``enabledWhen`` / ``visibleWhen``) are correctly set.


1.9.3 (Monday 20th March 2023)
------------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed potential infinite loop if a property value is set to the
  :class:`.HasProperties` instance.


1.9.2 (Wednesday 15th March 2023)
---------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* New :meth:`.HasProperties.wlisten` method, an alias for
  ``addListener(weak=False)``.


1.9.1 (Tuesday 21st February 2023)
----------------------------------


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Adjustments to the :class:`.ColourMap` property so that it prefers colour
  maps that are specified with the ``ColourMap`` over built-in ``matplotlib``
  colour maps.


1.9.0 (Monday 20th February 2023)
---------------------------------


Changed
^^^^^^^


* ``fsleyes-props`` now requires ``matplotlib >= 3.5.0``, and has been
  updated to use the new ``matplotlib.colormaps`` registry.


1.8.3 (Tuesday 7th February 2023)
---------------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed an issue in dependency specification.



1.8.2 (Monday 22nd August 2022)
-------------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed a bug whereby property definitions from a base class would be used
  when creating a :class:`.HasProperties` object, even if those properties
  were overwritten in a sub class.


1.8.1 (Thursday 18th August 2022)
---------------------------------


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Changed the initialisation logic for :class:`.Bounds` properties,
  so that if a ``default`` and ``minval``/``maxval`` are specified,
  the former is not overwritten by the latter.


1.8.0 (Thursday 18th August 2022)
---------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* New :attr:`fsleyes_props.Props`, :meth:`.HasProperties.listen`,
  :meth:`.HasProperties.ilisten`, :meth:`.HasProperties.remove`,
  :meth:`.HasProperties.bind`, :meth:`.HasProperties.unbind`,
  :meth:`.HasProperties.getatt`, and :meth:`.HasProperties.setatt`
  aliases.


Changed
^^^^^^^

* Property value listener functions can be defined to accept no arguments,
  if none are needed.
* The :class:`.Bounds` property type now accepts ``minval`` and ``maxval``
  options, for setting the initial minimum/maximum limits for each axis.
* The :func:`.suppress` and :func:`.skip` functions now accept one or
  more property names.


1.7.3 (Wednesday April 21st 2021)
---------------------------------


Changed
^^^^^^^

* Fixed deprecated usage of the ``matplotilb.cm.cmap_d`` colour map
  dictionary.


1.7.2 (Saturday March 27th 2021)
--------------------------------


Changed
^^^^^^^

* The :class:`.Color` property type now accepts any value that is accepted by
  the `matplotlib.to_rgba
  <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.colors.to_rgba.html>`_
  function.
* Properties of type The :class:`.Int` and :class:`.Real` can be set to
  ``None`` (unless ``required=True and allowInvalid=False``).


1.7.1 (Tuesday March 9th 2021)
------------------------------


Changed
^^^^^^^


* The ``fsleyes-props`` API documentation is now hosted at
  https://open.win.ox.ac.uk/pages/fsl/fsleyes/props/
