# <center> pathmagic
## <center> PathLib simplified to its most.
**pathmagic** is a lightweight Python utility module that simplifies common file and folder path operations using Python’s built-in `pathlib` library.

## Why use pathmagic?

Working with files and directories in Python can often involve repetitive and verbose code. `pathmagic` wraps the most frequently used operations into simple functions to help make your scripts cleaner, easier to read, and quicker to write.


## Features

- Create folders if they don’t exist
- Delete folders or files
- Check if a path exists
- Read and write text files
- Join paths easily across platforms
- List files or directories
- Get file names, extensions, and more




## Installation

This module has no external dependencies. You can simply copy it into your project or install it manually once published.

```bash
pip install pathmagic
