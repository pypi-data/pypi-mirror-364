# Jupyter Notebook Guidelines

When working with Jupyter notebook files (.ipynb), follow these guidelines:

## Language Requirements
- **Always write in English** - All code comments, markdown cells, and documentation should be in English
- Use clear, professional English for all explanations and descriptions

## Writing Style
- **Keep content concise** - Be brief and to the point
- Use clear, simple language that's easy to understand
- Focus on essential information only
- Avoid unnecessary verbose explanations

## Best Practices
- Write clean, readable code with minimal but effective comments
- Use markdown cells for brief explanations when needed
- Keep variable names descriptive but not overly long
- Structure notebooks logically with clear section headers

## Example Format
```python
# Load data and preprocess
data = load_dataset()
processed_data = preprocess(data)

# Train model
model = train_model(processed_data)
```

> **Note**: These guidelines ensure notebooks are professional, accessible, and maintainable.
