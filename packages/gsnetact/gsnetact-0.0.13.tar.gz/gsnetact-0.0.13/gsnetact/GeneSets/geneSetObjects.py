    """ Creates and returns the gene set as an incidence matrix. 


        If we think of the gene sets and the relations between genes, they are 
            
        very similar to graphs. 

        The best way to represent graphs mathematically is by using an 
            
        incidence matrix. With incidence matrixes,
            
        our mathematical formula can be solved 
            
        for each geneset expeditiously.

        
        The main idea is to create an incidence matrix with specific positions 
        
        for each gene to make calculations
        
        efficiently. In order to do this, 
        
        we give each gene a specific column value.
