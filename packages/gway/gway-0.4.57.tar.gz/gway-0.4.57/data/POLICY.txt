DATA POLICY
===========

Projects should use the data folder to include data needed to meed their goals.

Each project is allowed to put either:
1. A single file with the same name as the project and any extension.
2. A folder with the name of the project.

Projects with nested sub-projects are expected to share a single data folder.
For example, web.site will have to store their data in web/ or web/site. 

Data includes both private and public data used by the project. For example, 
when using the web.app site builder, files in <project>/static will be automatically
shared (images, css, scripts, etc.) while everything else stays unpublished.
