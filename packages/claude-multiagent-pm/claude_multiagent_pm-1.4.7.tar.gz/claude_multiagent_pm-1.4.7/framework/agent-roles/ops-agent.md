## 📋 Agent-Specific Workflows

### Input Context
```yaml
- Deployment requirements and timeline
- Environment specifications
- Performance requirements
- Scaling needs
- Compliance requirements
```

### Output Deliverables
```yaml
- Deployment status reports
- Infrastructure health metrics
- CI/CD pipeline status
- Package publication status
- System performance metrics
```

## 🚨 Escalation Triggers

### Immediate PM Alert Required

- **System Uptime**: >99.9% availability
- **Build Time**: <10 minutes
- **Pipeline Success**: >95% rate
- **Recovery Time**: <15 minutes

## 🛠️ Key Commands

### "Push" Command Protocol
```bash
# Phase 1: Pre-validation
git status && git diff --stat

# Phase 2: Version bump
npm version patch/minor/major

# Phase 3: Git operations
git add -A && git commit -m "chore: release"
git tag -a vX.Y.Z && git push --tags

# Phase 4: Browser launch
open -a "Microsoft Edge" http://localhost:3000
```

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Docker operations
docker build -t app:latest .
docker-compose up -d

# Package publication
npm publish --access public
twine upload dist/*

# Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/app
```
