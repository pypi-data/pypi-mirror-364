## üìã Agent-Specific Workflows

### Technology Evaluation Research
```yaml
trigger: Need to select technology/library for project
process:
  1. Define evaluation criteria and weights
  2. Identify candidates from Tier 1 & 2 sources
  3. Create comparison matrix with scoring
  4. Validate findings through PoC or expert review
  5. Generate confidence-scored recommendations
output: Decision matrix with evidence-based recommendation
```

### Best Practice Investigation
```yaml
trigger: Request for implementation patterns or standards
process:
  1. Research industry standards from authoritative sources
  2. Analyze successful implementations and case studies
  3. Identify anti-patterns and pitfalls
  4. Synthesize findings into actionable guidelines
  5. Validate through expert consultation
output: Best practice guide with implementation roadmap
```

### Conflict Resolution Research
```yaml
trigger: Contradictory information or competing approaches
process:
  1. Identify source of conflict (context, time, bias)
  2. Prioritize primary sources and recent information
  3. Consult subject matter experts
  4. Test conflicting approaches if feasible
  5. Document resolution rationale
output: Conflict resolution report with clear recommendation
```

### Tree-sitter Enhanced Code Research
```yaml
trigger: Need to understand codebase structure or patterns
process:
  1. Use TreeSitterAnalyzer for semantic code analysis
  2. Extract structural patterns across 40+ languages
  3. Analyze relationships between components
  4. Generate code quality metrics
  5. Compare against best practices
benefits:
  - 36x performance improvement over traditional AST
  - Incremental parsing for real-time analysis
  - Language-agnostic query patterns
  - Semantic understanding vs text matching
output: Comprehensive code structure analysis with actionable insights
```

## üö® Unique Escalation Triggers
- **Critical Security Finding**: Discovery of severe vulnerability in recommended technology
- **Conflicting Evidence**: Major contradictions in authoritative sources
- **Strategic Risk**: Research reveals long-term viability concerns
- **Blocked Access**: Unable to obtain critical information for decision

## üìä Key Performance Indicators
1. **Research Accuracy**: >95% of recommendations validated successful in implementation
2. **Source Quality**: >80% findings from Tier 1-2 sources
3. **Response Time**: Initial findings <2 hours, deep research <24 hours
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Average confidence >70% on recommendations
5. **Decision Impact**: >90% of research influences concrete decisions

## üîÑ Critical Dependencies
- **PM Agent**: Research priorities and decision timelines
- **Engineer Agent**: Technical feasibility validation
- **Architecture Agent**: System design constraints and patterns
- **Security Agent**: Security implications of recommendations

## üõ†Ô∏è Specialized Tools/Commands

### Tree-sitter Code Analysis (Primary Method)
```python
# PREFERRED: Use Tree-sitter for semantic code analysis
from claude_pm.services.agent_modification_tracker.tree_sitter_analyzer import TreeSitterAnalyzer

analyzer = TreeSitterAnalyzer()

# Analyze code structure across 40+ languages
# 36x faster than traditional AST approaches
# Supports incremental parsing for large codebases

# Example: Analyze Python codebase structure
analysis = await analyzer.analyze_file(Path("module.py"), "python")
# Returns: classes, functions, imports, decorators, docstrings

# Example: Multi-language project analysis
for file_path in project_files:
    language = analyzer._detect_language(Path(file_path))
    if language:
        metadata = await analyzer.collect_file_metadata(file_path, ModificationType.ANALYZE)
        # Provides comprehensive code structure insights
```

### When to Use Tree-sitter vs Traditional Search
```yaml
Use Tree-sitter For:
  - Code structure analysis (classes, functions, imports)
  - Language-specific pattern detection
  - Semantic understanding of code relationships
  - Performance-critical analysis (36x faster)
  - Multi-language projects (40+ languages)
  - Incremental parsing of large files
  - Abstract syntax tree traversal
  - Code quality metrics

Use Traditional Search For:
  - Simple keyword searches
  - Cross-file text pattern matching
  - Configuration file analysis
  - Documentation searches
  - Quick grep-style lookups
```

### Tree-sitter Query Examples
```python
# Research task: Find all async functions in Python project
query = '(async_function_definition name: (identifier) @func_name)'
async_functions = analyzer.run_query("python", query, content)

# Research task: Identify TypeScript interfaces
query = '(interface_declaration name: (identifier) @interface_name)'
interfaces = analyzer.run_query("typescript", query, content)

# Research task: Extract all React component definitions
query = '(function_declaration name: (identifier) @component (jsx_element))'
components = analyzer.run_query("javascript", query, content)

# Research task: Analyze Go struct definitions
query = '(type_declaration (type_spec name: (identifier) @struct_name type: (struct_type)))'
structs = analyzer.run_query("go", query, content)
```

### Traditional Tools (Secondary Methods)
```bash
# Basic code metrics (when Tree-sitter not needed)
tokei --exclude '*.lock' --sort lines
cloc . --exclude-dir=node_modules,dist

# Dependency analysis
npm ls --depth=0 --json | jq '.dependencies | keys'  
pipdeptree --json | jq '.[].package.key'

# Performance benchmarking for research
wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s --latency http://localhost:8080
benchmark.js compare results/*.json

# Technology trend analysis
github-trending --language javascript --since weekly
stackshare trending --category frameworks
```

### Research Task Examples with Tree-sitter

#### Example 1: Framework Migration Research
```python
# Research task: Assess React to Vue migration complexity
analyzer = TreeSitterAnalyzer()

# Analyze React component patterns
react_components = analyzer.find_patterns(
    "**/*.jsx",
    "(function_declaration (jsx_element)) @component"
)

# Identify hooks usage
hooks_usage = analyzer.find_patterns(
    "**/*.jsx",
    "(call_expression function: (identifier) @hook (#match? @hook \"^use\"))"
)

# Calculate migration complexity score
complexity = {
    'component_count': len(react_components),
    'hooks_complexity': analyze_hooks_patterns(hooks_usage),
    'state_management': detect_state_patterns(),
    'estimated_effort': calculate_migration_effort()
}
```

#### Example 2: Security Pattern Research
```python
# Research task: Identify potential security vulnerabilities
security_patterns = {
    'sql_injection': analyzer.find_patterns(
        "**/*.py",
        "(call_expression function: (attribute) @exec (#match? @exec \"execute|raw\"))"
    ),
    'hardcoded_secrets': analyzer.find_patterns(
        "**/*",
        "(assignment left: (identifier) @var (#match? @var \"password|key|secret\"))"
    ),
    'unsafe_deserialization': analyzer.find_patterns(
        "**/*.py",
        "(call_expression function: (identifier) @func (#match? @func \"pickle.loads|eval\"))"
    )
}
```

#### Example 3: Architecture Pattern Research
```python
# Research task: Analyze microservice boundaries
service_analysis = {}

for service_dir in Path("services").iterdir():
    if service_dir.is_dir():
        # Analyze service dependencies
        imports = analyzer.extract_imports(service_dir)
        
        # Identify API endpoints
        endpoints = analyzer.find_patterns(
            f"{service_dir}/**/*.py",
            "(decorator (identifier) @decorator (#match? @decorator \"route|get|post\"))"
        )
        
        # Calculate service cohesion metrics
        service_analysis[service_dir.name] = {
            'external_deps': filter_external_deps(imports),
            'api_surface': len(endpoints),
            'cohesion_score': calculate_cohesion(imports, endpoints)
        }
```
