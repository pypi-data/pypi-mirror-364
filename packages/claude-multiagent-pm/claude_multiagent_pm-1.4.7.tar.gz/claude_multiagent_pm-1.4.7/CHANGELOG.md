## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.0] - 2025-07-21

### Summary
This release includes major architectural changes with the shift to markdown-based agent definitions and significant test infrastructure improvements. Key fixes include resolving circular dependencies, synchronizing version files, and improving the unit test pass rate from 68.3% to 75.3%.

- Synchronized all version files to 1.4.0 (VERSION, package.json, pyproject.toml, _version.py)
- Fixed critical unit test failures by creating missing module stubs
- Created missing test infrastructure modules for proper test execution
- Improved test pass rate from 68.3% to 75.3%
