# Agent Trainer Module

## Overview

The Agent Trainer module is a comprehensive system for training and improving agent responses through specialized strategies, continuous learning, advanced analytics, and distributed processing capabilities. This module implements Phase 4 of the automatic prompt evaluation system (ISS-0125).

## Module Structure

The agent trainer functionality has been refactored into a modular directory structure for better organization and maintainability:

```

```

## Module Components

### Core Module (`__init__.py`)
The main `AgentTrainer` class that orchestrates all training operations:
- Initializes and coordinates all sub-modules
- Manages training sessions and templates
- Provides the main API for training agent responses
- Handles distributed processing with worker pools

### Types (`types.py`)
Defines all data structures used throughout the training system:
- `TrainingMode`: Enum for different training modes (CONTINUOUS, BATCH, ADAPTIVE)
- `TrainingDataFormat`: Enum for data formats (CODE, DOCUMENTATION, ANALYSIS, etc.)
- `TrainingTemplate`: Structure for agent-specific training templates
- `TrainingSession`: Complete training session data
- `LearningAdaptation`: Adaptation rules and effectiveness tracking
- `PerformancePrediction`: Predictive analytics data

### Strategies (`strategies.py`)
Agent-specific training strategies:
- `AgentTrainingStrategy`: Abstract base class
- `EngineerTrainingStrategy`: For code optimization and implementation
- `DocumentationTrainingStrategy`: For documentation improvement
- `QATrainingStrategy`: For testing and quality assurance
- `GenericTrainingStrategy`: Fallback for other agent types
- `create_training_strategy()`: Factory function for strategy creation

### Response Improver (`response_improver.py`)
Handles the actual response improvement:
- Caches improvements to avoid redundant processing
- Provides specialized improvement logic per agent type
- Integrates with the SharedPromptCache for performance

### Analytics (`analytics.py`)
Advanced analytics and prediction capabilities:
- Performance trend analysis
- Predictive modeling for future performance
- Adaptation effectiveness tracking
- Real-time performance monitoring

### Background Processor (`background_processor.py`)
Manages background tasks:
- Continuous learning loops
- Analytics updates
- Adaptation monitoring
- Automatic cleanup of old data

### Metrics (`metrics.py`)
Comprehensive metrics tracking:
- Training session metrics
- Agent-specific performance metrics
- Adaptation effectiveness metrics
- Statistical analysis and reporting

### Dashboard (`dashboard.py`)
Visualization and reporting:
- Agent-specific dashboards
- Training health status
- Data export functionality
- Performance visualizations

## Usage

### Basic Training Example

```python
from claude_pm.core.config import Config
from claude_pm.services.agent_trainer import AgentTrainer, TrainingMode

# Initialize
config = Config()
trainer = AgentTrainer(config)

# Start the training system
await trainer.start_training_system()

# Train an agent response
session = await trainer.train_agent_response(
    agent_type="engineer",
    original_response="def add(a, b): return a + b",
    context={"task_description": "Optimize the addition function"},
    training_mode=TrainingMode.CONTINUOUS
)

# Get training statistics
stats = await trainer.get_training_statistics()

# Get agent-specific dashboard
dashboard = await trainer.get_agent_training_dashboard("engineer")

# Export training data
export = await trainer.export_training_data(agent_type="engineer")

# Stop the system
await trainer.stop_training_system()
```

### Advanced Features

1. **Continuous Learning**: The system automatically adapts based on performance trends
2. **Background Processing**: Training tasks can be queued and processed asynchronously
3. **Multi-Agent Support**: Specialized strategies for different agent types
4. **Performance Predictions**: ML-based predictions for future performance
5. **Distributed Processing**: Utilizes worker pools for parallel processing

## Integration with Other Systems

The Agent Trainer integrates with:
- **AgentRegistry**: For discovering and loading agents
- **MirascopeEvaluator**: For response evaluation
- **CorrectionCapture**: For learning from corrections
- **EvaluationMetricsSystem**: For comprehensive metrics
- **SharedPromptCache**: For performance optimization

## Backward Compatibility

The original `agent_trainer.py` file has been replaced with a stub that imports everything from this module, ensuring backward compatibility for existing code.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Training Strategies**: Support for more agent types
2. **Advanced ML Models**: Integration with more sophisticated prediction models
3. **Real-time Dashboards**: WebSocket-based live dashboards
4. **Distributed Training**: Multi-node training support
5. **A/B Testing**: Built-in A/B testing for training strategies
