# Prompt Improver Module

## Overview

The Prompt Improver module implements an automated system for improving agent prompts based on correction patterns, evaluation feedback, and performance metrics. This module has been refactored from a single 1,107-line file into a well-organized package structure.

## Module Descriptions

### models.py
Contains all data models, enums, and dataclasses:
- `ImprovementStrategy` - Enum for improvement strategies (ADDITIVE, REPLACEMENT, CONTEXTUAL, STRUCTURAL)
- `PromptImprovement` - Dataclass for improvement records
- `CorrectionPattern` - Dataclass for correction patterns
- `ImprovementMetrics` - Dataclass for improvement effectiveness metrics
- Configuration defaults and constants

### pattern_analyzer.py
Handles pattern analysis and extraction:
- `PatternAnalyzer` - Analyzes correction data to identify patterns
- Pattern frequency calculation
- Severity assessment
- Common issue identification
- Improvement suggestion generation

### improvement_generator.py
Manages improvement generation:
- `ImprovementGenerator` - Generates prompt improvements from patterns
- Strategy selection based on pattern severity
- Multiple improvement strategies (additive, replacement, contextual, structural)
- Version management integration

### validator.py
Handles improvement validation:
- `ImprovementValidator` - Validates improvements through A/B testing
- Test scenario creation for different agent types
- Performance scoring and effectiveness calculation
- Approval/rejection decision making

### metrics_manager.py
Manages metrics and analytics:
- `MetricsManager` - Calculates and tracks improvement metrics
- Effectiveness distribution analysis
- Strategy and agent type analytics
- Rollback rate tracking
- Dashboard data generation

### storage_manager.py
Handles all file operations:
- `StorageManager` - Manages file I/O and versioning
- Pattern, improvement, and metrics persistence
- Prompt backup and restoration
- Version tracking and management
- Template file operations

### __init__.py
Main facade providing the public API:
- `PromptImprover` - Main class orchestrating all components
- Convenience functions for common operations
- Cache management
- Component initialization and coordination

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from claude_pm.services.prompt_improver import PromptImprover

# Initialize the improver
improver = PromptImprover()

# Analyze correction patterns
patterns = await improver.analyze_correction_patterns(
    agent_type='Documentation',
    days_back=30
)

# Generate improvements
improvements = await improver.generate_prompt_improvements(patterns)

# Validate improvements
validated = await improver.validate_improvements(improvements)

# Apply improvements
results = await improver.apply_improvements(validated)
```

### Convenience Functions

```python
from claude_pm.services.prompt_improver import (
    analyze_and_improve_prompts,
    get_improvement_dashboard
)

# One-step analysis and improvement
results = await analyze_and_improve_prompts(
    agent_type='QA',
    days_back=30
)

# Get comprehensive dashboard
dashboard = await get_improvement_dashboard()
```

## Backward Compatibility

The original `prompt_improver.py` file has been replaced with a stub that maintains full backward compatibility by re-exporting all public APIs from the new package structure.

## Configuration

The module can be configured through the config parameter:

```python
config = {
    'base_path': '.claude-pm/prompt_improvement',
    'improvement_threshold': 0.7,
    'pattern_min_frequency': 3,
    'validation_timeout': 300
}

improver = PromptImprover(config)
```

## Key Features

1. **Pattern Analysis** - Identifies recurring correction patterns across agents
2. **Automated Improvement** - Generates prompt improvements using multiple strategies
3. **Validation System** - A/B testing framework for improvement validation
4. **Version Management** - Tracks prompt versions and enables rollback
5. **Metrics Tracking** - Comprehensive analytics and effectiveness measurement
6. **Backup System** - Automatic backup before applying improvements

## Refactoring Benefits

- **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to understand and modify
- **Testability**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
- **Scalability**: New features can be added without affecting existing code
- **Performance**: Reduced file size from 1,107 to ~225 lines (80% reduction)
