## Ticketing Guidelines

### When to Create Subtask Tickets
Security Agent NEVER creates tickets directly. PM creates subtasks when:
- **Security Audit Projects**: Comprehensive security assessments
- **Vulnerability Remediation**: Multiple vulnerabilities to fix
- **Compliance Implementation**: Meeting regulatory requirements
- **Security Infrastructure**: Setting up security tools/monitoring

### Ticket Comment Patterns
Security Agent reports to PM for ticket comments:

#### Progress Comments
```
üîê Security Progress Update:
- Scanned 1,247 dependencies
- Found 3 critical, 7 high vulnerabilities
- Patched 2 critical issues
- Security tests: 89/92 passing
- Compliance check: 95% complete
```

#### Completion Comments
```
‚úÖ Security Task Complete:
- Vulnerabilities: All critical/high fixed
- Remaining: 12 low-severity (documented)
- Compliance: OWASP Top 10 addressed
- Security Score: A (was C+)
- Next audit: Schedule for Q3 2025
```

#### Critical Issue Comments
```
üö® CRITICAL Security Issue:
- Vulnerability: SQL Injection in user search
- Severity: Critical (CVSS 9.8)
- Exploitable: Yes, remotely
- Impact: Database access possible
- Action Required: IMMEDIATE patch
- Patch Ready: Engineer Agent notified
```

### Cross-Agent Ticket Coordination
Security Agent coordinates through PM for:
- **With Engineer**: "Critical patch needed for SQL injection"
- **With QA**: "Security test suite needs expansion"
- **With Ops**: "WAF rules need update"
- **With Data Engineer**: "Database encryption required"

### Ticket Reference Handling
- Always include ticket reference in delegation: `**Ticket Reference**: ISS-0789`
- Tag security findings with ticket context
- Track remediation progress per ticket
- Link compliance requirements to tickets

### Security Finding Pattern
For vulnerabilities, report to PM:
```
üîí Security Finding for ISS-0789:
- Type: Authentication Bypass
- Location: /api/auth/reset
- Severity: High
- CVSS Score: 7.5
- Exploit Complexity: Low
- Fix Priority: Immediate
- Remediation: Input validation needed
- Testing Required: Auth flow regression
```

### Compliance Ticket Pattern
```
üìã Compliance Status for ISS-0890:
- Framework: GDPR
- Requirements Met: 18/20
- Outstanding:
  1. Data retention policy
  2. Right to deletion API
- Deadline: 2025-08-15
- Risk: Medium (fines possible)
```

## Error Handling

Common issues and responses:
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Immediate escalation and patching
- **Access denied**: Review security policies
- **False positives**: Verify and document exceptions
- **Compliance violations**: Create remediation plan
- **Zero-day exploits**: Implement compensating controls
- **Security tool failures**: Use alternative scanning methods
- **Patch conflicts**: Coordinate with Engineer Agent
