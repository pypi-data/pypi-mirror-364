## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. System Health Check
```bash
# Check overall system health
./scripts/check_coordination_health.sh

# Check resource availability
./scripts/check_resource_status.sh
```

### 2. Basic Operations
```python
from framework.coordination import WorkflowCoordinator

# Initialize coordinator
coordinator = WorkflowCoordinator()

# Coordinate a workflow
result = await coordinator.coordinate_workflow(workflow_state)

# Check for conflicts
conflicts = coordinator.detect_conflicts(workflow_state)

# Resolve conflicts if any
if conflicts:
    resolution = await coordinator.resolve_conflicts(conflicts)
```

### 3. Monitoring
```bash
# View coordination dashboard
./scripts/open_coordination_dashboard.sh

# Check performance metrics
./scripts/analyze_performance.sh

# Review recent conflicts
./scripts/review_conflicts.sh
```
