# splinebox
A python package for fitting splines.
Developed by the [EPFL Center for Imaging](https://imaging.epfl.ch/) as part of a collaboration with the [Uhlmann Group at EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/uhlmann/) in Feb 2024.

## Features
* Flexible spline fitting for various applications.
* Support for many spline types in any dimesnionality.
* High-perfomance implementation in Python
* Extensive [documentation](https://splinebox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) with [examples](https://splinebox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/index.html)

## Installation

You can install `splinebox` via pip:
```
pip install splinebox
```

## Usage

Here is a minimal example of a cubic B-spline in 2D with 3 knots.

```python
import splinebox
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

n_knots = 4
spline = splinebox.spline_curves.Spline(M=n_knots, basis_function=splinebox.basis_functions.B3(), closed=True)
spline.knots = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 2], [4, 3], [1, 1]])

t = np.linspace(0, n_knots, 100)
vals = spline(t, derivative=0)

plt.scatter(spline.knots[:, 0], spline.knots[:, 1])
plt.plot(vals[:, 0], vals[:, 1])
plt.show()
```

## Support

If you encounter any problems, please [file and issue](https://github.com/EPFL-Center-for-Imaging/splinebox/issues/new) describing the issue and include minimal example to reproduce the issue.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Before you submit a pull request, please ensure that the tests are passing. You can run the tests with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). If you are unsure how to implement something, feel free to open an issue to discuss.
