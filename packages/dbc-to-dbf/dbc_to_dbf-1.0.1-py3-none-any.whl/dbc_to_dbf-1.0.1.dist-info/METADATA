# dbc-to-dbf

A pure Python utility to convert `.dbc` files into standard `.dbf` format ‚Äî commonly used in public health data from the Brazilian government.

`.dbc` files are a compressed form of `.dbf` (dBase format) files used by **DATASUS**, the Department of Informatics of the **Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS)**.  
DATASUS provides large-scale public health datasets (such as hospital admissions, mortality records, disease surveillance, and more) in `.dbc` format to reduce file size and facilitate distribution.

These `.dbc` files are compressed using a legacy algorithm known as **PKWare DCL "implode"**, originally used in older versions of ZIP files. This format is no longer widely supported, and modern decompression libraries (like `zipfile` or `gzip`) **do not handle `.dbc` files**.

This project provides a **pure Python implementation** of the **BLAST decompression algorithm**, which is compatible with the compression used in `.dbc` files. It is a direct, object-oriented rewrite of `blast.c` by Mark Adler (co-author of zlib), adapted and modernized for Python usage.

With this library, researchers, data analysts, public health professionals, and developers can easily **extract health data from DATASUS** in a readable and processable format ‚Äî enabling analysis, dashboards, research, and more.

## üñ•Ô∏è Example CLI script (for custom use)

```python

    import sys
    from dbctodbf import DBCDecompress

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        if len(sys.argv) != 3:
            print("Uso: python script.py <entrada.dbc> <saida.dbf>")
            sys.exit(1)

        input_file = sys.argv[1]
        output_file = sys.argv[2]

        try:
            dbc2dbf = DBCDecompress()
            dbc2dbf.decompressFile(input_file, output_file)
            print(f"Convers√£o conclu√≠da: {output_file}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Erro ao converter: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)
```
