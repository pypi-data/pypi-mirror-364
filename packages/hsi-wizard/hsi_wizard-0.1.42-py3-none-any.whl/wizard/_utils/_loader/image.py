.. module:: images
:platform: Unix
:synopsis: Provides functions to read and write image files.

Module Overview
---------------

This module includes functions for reading images from files and converting them into a `DataCube`.
It supports various image formats and allows for batch processing of images from a folder.

def filter_image_files(files):

    Filters a list of filenames, returning only those that have image file extensions.

    The function checks for the following image file extensions (case-insensitive):
    - .jpg

    - .gif
    - .bmp
    - .tiff

    >>> files = ["image.jpg", "document.pdf", "photo.png", "archive.zip"]
    >>> image_files = filter_image_files(files)

    Load image(s) into a DataCube.

    This function supports both a single image file path or a list of image file paths.
    Images are processed based on the specified type, which determines the transpose operation applied to the data.

    :param path: Path to an image file or a list of image file paths.
    If a list is provided, images are loaded concurrently.
    :type path: str or list[str]
    :param kwargs: Optional keyword arguments.
    - type: Specifies the transpose operation to apply to the data.
    Can be 'default' (default behavior) or 'pushbroom' (for pushbroom images).
    - Other keyword arguments may be accepted depending on the implementation of `load_image`.

    :returns: A DataCube object containing the image data.
