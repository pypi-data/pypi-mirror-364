Overview
========

The core functionality of `hsi-wizard` includes:

- **DataCube Class**: Manage, track, and process HSI data using a powerful object-oriented model
- **Spectral Visualization**: Plot and explore spectral data through interactive and static visualizations
- **Clustering and Analytics**: Apply clustering techniques and perform exploratory data analysis
- **File Format Support**: Seamless integration with various formats, including `.nrrd`, `.pickle`, `.csv`, and `.xlsx`

For a detailed breakdown of each module, refer to the :ref:`Modules <Modules>` section below.

Installation
============

You can install `hsi-wizard` via pip or compile it from source.

Install via pip
---------------
To install the latest release using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install hsi-wizard

Install from Source
-------------------
To install from source:

.. code-block:: console

   python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel             # Install/update build tools
   git clone https://github.com/BlueSpacePotato/hsi-wizard   # Clone the repository
   cd hsi-wizard                                             # Navigate into the project directory
   python -m venv .venv                                      # Create a virtual environment
   source .venv/bin/activate                                 # Activate the environment
   pip install -e .                                          # Install in editable mode


Comparison with with Existing Tools
===================================

Most existing hyperspectral‐imaging packages—whether open‑source (e.g. PySptools, SPy, HyDe) or commercial (ENVI, Spectronon)—are aimed at geospatial tasks or GUI‑driven workflows, with limited scripting, batch automation or biomedical support.

In contrast, hsi‑wizard is an open‑source, Python‐native toolkit built for biomedical imaging. It handles ENVI, CSV, NRRD, TDMS and other formats; offers multimodal fusion, protocol logging and scriptable pipelines; and delivers fully reproducible, automated processing of diverse spectral datasets—bridging the gap between low‑level algorithm libraries and rigid GUI systems.

Geospatial limitation
=====================

This package does not support geospatial tracking or coordinate processing. If you require GIS integration or full remote-sensing capabilities, consider complementary tools.
