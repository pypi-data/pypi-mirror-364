Copyright (c) 2025 OceanCrow

All rights reserved by Sheldon Kenny Salmon, sole proprietor, until OceanCrow LLC is established. Post-establishment, all rights transfer to OceanCrow LLC.

Permission is hereby granted, for a one-time fee of $5, to any individual or entity (hereinafter "Licensee") obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), subject to the following ironclad conditions:

## 1. Usage and Modification Rights

The Licensee may use, copy, modify, and create derivative works of the Software for personal, commercial, or industry-specific projects (e.g., gaming, defense, finance) upon download. This permission is granted as a one-time purchase with no refunds, reflecting the Software's intended adaptability.

## 2. Immediate Liability Transfer

All liability, risk, and responsibility for the Software's use, modification, distribution, or application—whether in games, other industries, or derivative products—shifts entirely to the Licensee the moment the Software is downloaded to their device (phone, PC, or otherwise). OceanCrow and Sheldon Kenny Salmon, as well as any future OceanCrow LLC, are absolved of all accountability for any damages, claims, or losses arising thereafter.

## 3. No Redistribution Without Permission

The Licensee may not redistribute, sublicense, or sell the Software or any derivative works in its original or modified form without express written consent from OceanCrow. Unauthorized distribution, sale, or commercial exploitation voids this license and may result in legal action, including but not limited to claims for copyright infringement and damages.

## 4. Ownership and Attribution

OceanCrow and Sheldon Kenny Salmon retain full copyright and ownership of the Software. The Licensee may not claim intellectual property rights over the Software or its derivatives. The original copyright notice, this license, and the OceanCrow branding must be prominently included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software, even if modified, serving as a traceable marker of origin.

## 5. No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. OCEANCROW AND SHELDON KENNY SALMON EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES, CLAIMS, OR LOSSES ARISING FROM THE SOFTWARE'S USE, MODIFICATION, OR DISTRIBUTION, REGARDLESS OF CIRCUMSTANCE.

## 6. No Support or Maintenance

The Software is provided without support, updates, or maintenance. OceanCrow is not obligated to provide assistance, fixes, or updates. For inquiries, Licensees must purchase a paid support ticket via Gumroad with a valid invoice number, as per OceanCrow's website policies.

## 7. Proton Email Privilege

Licensees achieving 10 consecutive purchases totaling over $1,000 may, at OceanCrow's discretion, access a private Proton email. This privilege does not guarantee responses unless accompanied by a paid ticket.

## 8. Universal Adapter Disclaimer

The Universal Adapter is provided as a creative tool to inspire innovation across industries. Any adaptation or application (e.g., defense radar, financial algorithms) using this tool is the Licensee's sole responsibility. OceanCrow neither endorses nor guides specific implementations.

## 9. Respect Clause and Deterrence

This Software is offered in the spirit of innovation and respect. Unauthorized distribution, sale, or misuse, including removal of OceanCrow branding, will result in immediate license termination, potential legal action, and public disclosure of the breach on OceanCrow's platforms. Respect begets respect; honor this code's origin to maintain access.

## 10. Termination and Liability Shield

This license terminates instantly upon breach of any condition. Upon termination, the Licensee must destroy all copies of the Software. OceanCrow and Sheldon Kenny Salmon, as well as any future OceanCrow LLC, are fully protected from liability from the moment of purchase, akin to a mint releasing a crisp product—once it leaves OceanCrow's hands, its fate is the Licensee's alone.

## 11. Legal Note

This license is governed by the laws of NewYork, USA. Any attempt to impose liability on OceanCrow or Sheldon Kenny Salmon is null and void, as the Software's use and modification are the Licensee's responsibility post-download. OceanCrow reserves the right to pursue legal remedies for copyright infringement, with all legal costs borne by the infringing party.
