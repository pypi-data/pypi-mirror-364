class Scene(ABC):
    """
    The Scene class is an abstract class to be used as a base class for any scenes that you want to create.

    In the startup code for your  application, you create an instance of each of the
    scenes that you want to be available.  Then you build a dictionary like this

        |    {<sceneKey1>:<sceneObject1>, <sceneKey2>:<sceneObject2>, ...}

    Then you pass this dictionary when you instantiate the Scene Manager.
    See the SceneMgr documentation for details.

    To create a scene, you must write a subclass that inherits from this class.
    Your class must implement these methods

        |   __init__(), update(), draw(), get_scene_key()

    Other methods can be overridden if you wish:

        | enter(), leave()

    You can add any additional methods that your class requires.
    Additionally, there are other methods to allow you to get or set info, or navigate to other scenes:

        | go_to_scene(), quit(), request(), respond() and more.

    In the __init__() method of your scene subclass, you will receive a window reference.
    You should copy this into an instance variable like this, and use it when drawing:

        |    def __init__(self, screen):
        |        self.screen = screen
        |        self.screen_rect = screen.get_rect()
        |        # Add any initialization you want to do here.


        You also need to write a get_scene_key() method that returns a string
        or constant that uniquely identifies the scene.  It is recommended that you
        build and import a Constants.py file that contains constants for each scene,
        and use the key associated with the current scene here.
        |    def get_scene_key(self):
        |        return <string or CONSTANT that identifies this scene>

    When your scene is active, the SceneManager calls a standard set of methods in the current scene.
    Therefore, all scenes must implement these methods (polymorphism):

        |    update()        # called in every frame
        |    draw()          # called in every frame

    The following methods can optionally be implemented in a scene.  If they are not
    implemented, then the null version in the Scene subclass will be used.
    (The Scene class' default versions only execute a pass statement):

        |    enter()          # called once whenever the scene is entered
        |    update()         # called in every frame
        |    leave()          # called once whenever the scene is left

    When you want to go to a new scene, call:

        |    self.go_to_scene() and pass in the sceneKey of the scene you want to go to,
        |    and optionally, pass any data you want the next scene to receive in its enter() method.

    If you want to quit the program from your scene, call:
        |    self.quit()
