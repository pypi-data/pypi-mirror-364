# PyDCSL 🛡️🔐  
*A compact Python tool to check if a Widevine device certificate (DCSL) is revoked or valid.*

## 📦 What is PyDCSL?
**PyDCSL** is a lightweight Python utility that interacts with a custom API to process **Widevine license components** — specifically `.wvd`, `client_id`, and `private_key` files — and fetch the corresponding DRM metadata.  
It acts as a tool for **DRM inspection**, metadata extraction, and license validation purposes. The tool provides both a command-line interface (CLI) and an importable Python module.
