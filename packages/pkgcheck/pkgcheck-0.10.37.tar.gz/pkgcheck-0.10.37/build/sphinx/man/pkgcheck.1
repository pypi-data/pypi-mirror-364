.UNINDENT
.SS Arches
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-a, \-\-arches ARCH\fP
Comma separated list of arches to enable and disable.
.sp
To specify disabled arches prefix them with \(aq\-\(aq. Note that when
starting the argument list with a disabled arch an equals sign
must be used, e.g. \-a=\-arch, otherwise the disabled arch
argument is treated as an option.
.sp
By default all repo defined arches are used; however,
stable\-related checks (e.g. UnstableOnly) default to the set of
arches having stable profiles in the target repo.
.UNINDENT
.SS Profiles
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-p, \-\-profiles PROFILE\fP
Comma separated list of profiles to enable and disable for
scanning. Any profiles specified in this fashion will be the
only profiles that get scanned, skipping any disabled profiles.
In addition, if no profiles are explicitly enabled, all
profiles defined in the target repo\(aqs profiles.desc file will be
scanned except those marked as experimental (exp).
.sp
To specify disabled profiles prefix them with \fB\-\fP which
removes the from the list of profiles to be considered. Note
that when starting the argument list with a disabled profile an
equals sign must be used, e.g.  \fB\-p=\-path/to/profile\fP,
otherwise the disabled profile argument is treated as an
option.
.sp
The special keywords of \fBstable\fP, \fBdev\fP, \fBexp\fP, and
\fBdeprecated\fP correspond to the lists of stable, development,
experimental, and deprecated profiles, respectively. Therefore,
to only scan all stable profiles pass the \fBstable\fP argument
to \-\-profiles. Additionally the keyword \fBall\fP can be used to
scan all defined profiles in the target repo.
.UNINDENT
.SS Git
.sp
Git repo support for various checks.
.sp
Pkgcheck can create virtual package repos from a given git repo\(aqs history
in order to provide more info for checks relating to stable requests,
outdated blockers, or local commits. These virtual repos are cached and
updated every run if new commits are detected.
.sp
Git repos must have a supported config in order to work properly.
Specifically, pkgcheck assumes that the origin branch exists and tracks
upstream.
.sp
Additionally, the origin/HEAD ref must exist. If it doesn\(aqt, running \fBgit
remote set\-head origin master\fP or similar for other branches will create
it.
.sp
You can override the default git remote used for all git comparison using
\fB\-\-git\-remote\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-commits [tree\-ish]\fP
Targets are determined from the committed changes compared to a
given reference that defaults to the repo\(aqs origin.
.sp
For example, to scan all the packages that have been changed in
the current branch compared to the branch named \(aqold\(aq use
\fBpkgcheck scan \-\-commits old\fP\&. For two separate branches
named \(aqold\(aq and \(aqnew\(aq use \fBpkgcheck scan \-\-commits old..new\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-staged [tree\-ish]\fP
Targets are determined using all staged changes for the git
repo. Unstaged changes and untracked files are ignored by
temporarily stashing them during the scanning process.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-git\-remote REMOTE\fP
The git remote to be used for all operations by pkgcheck. The
default value, and the recommended value is \fBorigin\fP, but
you can use any valid git remote name.

.SS Synopsis
.sp
pkgcheck replay [\-R REPORTER] [\-\-format FORMAT_STR] [\-h] [\-\-debug] [\-q] [\-v] [\-\-color BOOLEAN] FILE
.SS Description
.sp
Replay previous json result streams, feeding the results into a reporter.
.sp
Useful if you need to delay acting on results until it can be done in
one minimal window, e.g. updating a database, or want to generate
several different reports.
.SS Positional Arguments
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
Use \fBpkgcheck show \-\-reporters\fP to see available options.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-format FORMAT_STR\fP
Custom format string used to format output by FormatReporter.
.sp
Supports python format string syntax where result object attribute names
surrounded by curly braces are replaced with their values (if they exist).
.sp
For example, \fB\-\-format \(aq{category}/{package}/{package}\-{version}.ebuild\fP
will output ebuild paths in the target repo for results relating to
specific ebuild versions. If a result is for the generic package (or a
higher scope), no output will be produced for that result.
.sp
Furthermore, no output will be produced if a result object is missing any
requested attribute expansion in the format string. In other words,
\fB\-\-format {foo}\fP will never produce any output because no result has the
\fBfoo\fP attribute.

.SS Main Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-f, \-\-filter FILTER\fP
Support limiting targeted packages for scanning using a chosen filter.
.sp
If the \(aqlatest\(aq argument is used, only the latest package per slot of
both VCS and non\-VCS types will be scanned. This can either be
specified individually in which case the filter will be applied
globally to all checks or it can be applied to specific checksets,
checks, or keywords using the syntax \(aqlatest:ObjName\(aq which would apply
the filter to the keyword, check, or checkset named ObjName (in that
order of precedence).
.sp
By default, some checks have filtering enabled, e.g. various
network\-related checks are filtered to avoid redundant or unnecessary
server requests. In order to forcibly disable all filtering use the
\(aqno\(aq argument.
.TP
.B \fB\-j, \-\-jobs JOBS\fP
Number of checks to run in parallel, defaults to using all available
processors.
.TP
.B \fB\-t, \-\-tasks TASKS\fP
Number of asynchronous tasks to run concurrently (defaults to 5 * CPU count).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cache CACHE\fP
All cache types are enabled by default, this option explicitly sets
which caches will be generated and used during scanning.
.sp
To enable only certain cache types, specify them in a comma\-separated
list, e.g. \fB\-\-cache git,profiles\fP will enable both the git and
profiles caches.
.sp
To disable specific cache types prefix them with \fB\-\fP\&. Note
that when starting the argument list with a disabled value an equals
sign must be used, e.g. \fB\-\-cache=\-git\fP, otherwise the disabled
argument is treated as an option.
.sp
In order to disable all cache usage, it\(aqs easiest to use \fB\-\-cache no\fP
instead of explicitly listing all disabled cache types.
.sp
When disabled, no caches will be saved to disk and results requiring
caches (e.g. git\-related checks) will be skipped.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-cache\-dir CACHE_DIR\fP
directory to use for storing cache files
.TP
.B \fB\-\-exit [ITEM]\fP
Comma\-separated list of checksets, checks, or keywords to enable and
disable that trigger an exit status failure. Checkset and check
arguments expand into their respective keyword sets.
.sp
If no arguments or only disabled arguments are passed, enabled
arguments are the set of error level keywords.
.sp
To specify disabled keywords prefix them with \fB\-\fP\&. Also, the special
arguments of \fBerror\fP, \fBwarning\fP, \fBstyle\fP, and \fBinfo\fP correspond
to the related keyword groups.
.UNINDENT
.SS Check Selection
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-net\fP

.TP
.B \fB\-C, \-\-checksets CHECKSET\fP
Comma\-separated list of checksets to enable and disable for
scanning.
.sp
The special argument of \fBall\fP corresponds to the list of all checks.
Therefore, to forcibly enable all checks use \fB\-C all\fP\&.
.sp
All network\-related checks (which are disabled by default)
can be enabled using \fB\-C net\fP\&. This allows for easily running only
network checks without having to explicitly list them.
.TP
.B \fB\-s, \-\-scopes SCOPE\fP
Comma\-separated list of scopes to enable and disable for scanning. Any
scopes specified in this fashion will affect the checks that get
run. For example, running pkgcheck with only the repo scope
enabled will cause only repo\-level checks to run.
.sp
Available scopes: git, profiles, eclass, repo, cat, pkg, ver
.TP
.B \fB\-c, \-\-checks CHECK\fP
Comma\-separated list of checks to enable and disable for
scanning. Any checks specified in this fashion will be the
only checks that get run, skipping any disabled checks.
.sp
To disable checks prefix them with \fB\-\fP\&. Note that when starting the
argument list with a disabled check an equals sign must be used, e.g.
\fB\-c=\-check\fP, otherwise the disabled check argument is treated as an
option.
.sp
Additive arguments are also supported using the prefix \fB+\fP that adds
to the default set of enabled checks. This is useful in order to enable
optional checks in addition to the default set.
.sp
Use \fBpkgcheck show \-\-checks\fP see all available checks.
.TP
.B \fB\-k, \-\-keywords KEYWORD\fP
Comma\-separated list of keywords to enable and disable for
scanning. Any keywords specified in this fashion will be the
only keywords that get reported, skipping any disabled keywords.
.sp
To specify disabled keywords prefix them with \fB\-\fP\&. Note that when
starting the argument list with a disabled keyword an equals sign must
be used, e.g. \fB\-k=\-keyword\fP, otherwise the disabled keyword argument is
treated as an option.
.sp
The special arguments of \fBerror\fP, \fBwarning\fP, \fBstyle\fP, and
\fBinfo\fP correspond to the related keyword groups. For example, to only
scan for errors use \fB\-k error\fP\&.
.sp
Use \fBpkgcheck show \-\-keywords\fP to see available options.

starting the argument list with a disabled arch an equals sign
must be used, e.g. \-a=\-arch, otherwise the disabled arch
argument is treated as an option.
.sp
By default all repo defined arches are used; however,
stable\-related checks (e.g. UnstableOnly) default to the set of
arches having stable profiles in the target repo.
.UNINDENT
.SS Profiles

In addition, if no profiles are explicitly enabled, all
profiles defined in the target repo\(aqs profiles.desc file will be
scanned except those marked as experimental (exp).
.sp
To specify disabled profiles prefix them with \fB\-\fP which
removes the from the list of profiles to be considered. Note
that when starting the argument list with a disabled profile an

.SH CONFIG FILE SUPPORT
.sp
Config files are supported by \fBpkgcheck scan\fP from any of four locations.
Listed in order of increasing precedence these include the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
system config \-\- \fB/etc/pkgcheck/pkgcheck.conf\fP
.IP \(bu 2
user config \-\- \fB${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/pkgcheck/pkgcheck.conf\fP
.IP \(bu 2
user config \-\- \fB~/.config/pkgcheck/pkgcheck.conf\fP
.IP \(bu 2
repo config \-\- \fBmetadata/pkgcheck.conf\fP inside an ebuild repo (only
considered when the current directory is inside the repo, or when specified
using \fB\-\-repo\fP option)
.IP \(bu 2
custom config \-\- specified via the \fB\-\-config\fP option
.UNINDENT
.sp
Any settings from a config file with higher precedence will override matching
settings from a config file with a lower precedence, e.g. repo settings
override both user and system settings. Note that command line options override
any matching config file setting.
.sp
In terms of file structure, basic INI formatting is required and allows
creating a default section (DEFAULT) for system\-wide settings or repo\-specific
sections. The INI key\-value pairs directly relate to the available
long\-options supported by \fBpkgcheck scan\fP and their related values. See the
following examples for how certain config settings affect scanning:

Custom checksets can also be configured via the CHECKSETS section. In essence,
a checkset is an alias for a group of checks or keywords which can either be
enabled or disabled. Configured checkset names can then be used with the
\fBpkgcheck scan \-C/\-\-checkset\fP option enabling scanning for configured, custom
sets of results. See the following examples for how to configure them:
