 * @brief   Methods for detecting network matrices
 * @author  Rolf van der Hulst
 *
 * This file contains algorithms for incrementally growing (augmenting) network matrices,
 * which are a large subclass of totally unimodular matrices.
 *
 * @addtogroup NetworkMatrix
 *
 * @{
 *
 * A matrix \f$M \in \{-1,0,1\}^{m\times n} \f$ is a network matrix if there exists a directed graph \f$G = (V,A)\f$
 * with \f$|A| = m+n\f$ arcs and a spanning forest \f$T\f$ with \f$|T| = m\f$ such that \f$M\f$'s rows index \f$T\f$ and
 * \f$M\f$'s columns index \f$A\setminus T\f$,
 * and for each arc \f$ a = (u,v) \in A\setminus T\f$ and each arc \f$t\in T\f$
 * \f[
 *   M_{t,a} = \begin{cases}
 *   +1 &  \textrm{if the unique } u-v \textrm{ path in } T \textrm{ passes through } a \textrm{ forwardly}, \\
 *   -1 &  \textrm{if the unique } u-v \textrm{ path in } T \textrm{ passes through } a \textrm{ backwardly}, \\
 *   0 &   \textrm{if the unique } u-v \textrm{ path in } T \textrm{ does not pass through } a
 *   \end{cases}
 * \f]
 * holds.
 *
 * The main difficulty with detecting network matrices is that there may exist many pairs of a graph and a spanning tree
 * that realize a matrix. The algorithms in this file maintain and update an SPQR forest, which is a graph decomposition
 * that represents all graphs that correspond to a given network matrix.
 *
 * Note that all addition algorithms expect that each nonzero is given exactly once and not more often; in particular,
 * it is up to the user to ensure this when interleaving column and row addition steps.
 *
 * More details can be found in:
 * - R.P. van der Hulst and M. Walter "A Row-wise Algorithm for Graph Realization"
 * - R.E. Bixby and D.K. Wagner "An almost linear-time algorithm for graph realization"
 *
 * Note that although these publications contain the methods for undirected graphs (and binary matrices),
 * their ideas are relatively easily extended to directed graphs and ternary matrices.
 * Implementation details are described in further detail in network.c
