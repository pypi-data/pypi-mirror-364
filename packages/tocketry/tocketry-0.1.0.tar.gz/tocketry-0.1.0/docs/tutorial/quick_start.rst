Quick start
===========

Topics of the section:

- Installing
- Minimal example

Installing
----------

Install the package from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/tocketry/>`_:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install tocketry

Minimal Example
---------------

Next, we make a quick and minimal application:

.. literalinclude:: /code/demos/minimal.py
    :language: py

We initialized the Tocketry application, created one task
which runs every day and then we started the app.
This is nothing fancy but gets you stared. 

What next

This is only a small slice what Tocketry has to offer. Read further 
to explore the features.
