This document provides instructions for setting up a development environment for the PCILeech Firmware Generator project.


---

## üöÄ Development Setup

The code needs to run on linux but can be developed anywhere with a python vers >3.9

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ramseymcgrath/PCILeechFWGenerator
cd PCILeechFWGenerator

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run tests
pytest tests/
```

## üì¶ Building from Source

```bash
# Build distributions
python -m build

# Install locally
pip install dist/*.whl

```

## Unit testing

TUI Tests are next to the code in the tui dir, app tests are in the tests/ dir.
`make test` in the repo is the easiest way to run unit tests locally. The github action will run them in CI.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

**Quick Start:**
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Run the test suite (`pytest`)
6. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add amazing feature'`)
7. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
8. Open a Pull Request

## üß™ Testing

The project uses pytest for testing. Run the test suite with:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_specific_module.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

## üìù Code Style

This project follows these coding standards:

- PEP 8 for Python code style
- Black for code formatting
- isort for import sorting
- flake8 for linting
- mypy for type checking

Pre-commit hooks are configured to enforce these standards.

## üîß Device Driver Management

### VFIO-PCI Binding

The firmware generator manages PCIe device drivers during the build process. Here are some important implementation details:

- **Driver Detection**: The system checks the current driver bound to a device before attempting to bind it to vfio-pci
- **Automatic Skip**: If a device is already bound to vfio-pci, the binding process is skipped automatically
- **Error Handling**: Even if the bind command fails but the device is actually bound to vfio-pci, the system will detect this and continue
- **Driver Restoration**: After the build completes, the system attempts to restore the original driver

This approach ensures smooth operation even in edge cases like:
- Multiple consecutive builds using the same device
- Manual pre-binding of devices to vfio-pci
- Race conditions during driver binding

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
