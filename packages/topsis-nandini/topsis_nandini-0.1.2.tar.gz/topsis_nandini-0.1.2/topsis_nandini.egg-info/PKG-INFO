> This package implements the **TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** algorithm — a widely used multi-criteria decision analysis method.

---

## 📌 What is TOPSIS?

**TOPSIS** is an algorithm that helps in ranking and selecting from a set of alternatives based on multiple criteria.  
It is based on the concept that the chosen alternative should have the **shortest distance from the ideal solution** and the **farthest from the negative-ideal solution**.

It is especially useful in areas like:
- Decision-making systems
- Recommendation engines
- Business and financial analysis
- Supply chain and logistics

---

## 🚀 Features

- Simple and clean API
- Accepts CSV or pandas DataFrame input
- Supports weighted and normalized decision matrices
- Generates final rankings of alternatives

---

## 📦 Installation

Install the package directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org):

```bash
pip install topsis-nandini==0.1.2
```

## 🛠️ Usage
```bash
# 1. Run via Python module
python -m topsis data.csv "0.4,0.3,0.3" "+,-,+"

# 2. Use inside Python script
from topsis import topsis
topsis.run("data.csv", "0.4,0.3,0.3", "+,-,+")
```
