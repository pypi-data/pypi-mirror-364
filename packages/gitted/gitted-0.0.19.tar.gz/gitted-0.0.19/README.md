If all you need to do with Git is make branches, push, and sync,
this collection of command-line commands may simplify your workflow.
Well, it simplifies mine, a [hundred](https://github.com/yegor256)
times per day.

First, install [Python3], [Git], [pip], [gh], and [Bash].

Then, install this Python package (with Bash scripts inside):

```bash
pip install gitted==0.0.18
```

Then, in order to make a contribution to a GitHub repo, assuming
you've made a [fork][fork2] already and cloned it (in the command line):

First, start a branch to resolve issue no. 42 (for example):

```bash
branch 42
```

Then, write some code and add+commit it (no push):

```bash
commit 'Just fixed a small bug'
```

Then, pull recent changes from the `master` of the upstream:

```bash
pull
```

Finally, write more code and add+commit+push it:

```bash
push 'Just fixed a big bug'
```

If you omit the commit message for the `commit` or the `push` command,
they will use ChatGPT to generate it, looking at the changes you've made.
To make it work, define the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with the
[OpenAI key].

## Conventions

In order to work smoothly, you must respect a few conventions:

* Branch names are always integers, equal to GitHub issue numbers ([why?][nums])
* All commits are GPG-signed, if you have a key ([how?][gpg])
* The `origin` is the fork, while the `upstream` is the main repo ([why?][fork])

Perhaps in future versions we'll make these configurable.
However, at the moment, that's what we have.

## How to Contribute

Install [GNU make] and [uv]. Then, run:

```bash
make
```

Should build.
If it doesn't, submit a bug report.
