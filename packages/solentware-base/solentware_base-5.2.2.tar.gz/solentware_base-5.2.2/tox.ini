# tox.ini exists because pyproject.toml is not supported by pycodestyle,
# and because setup.cfg would be rewritten by 'python -m build'.

# pycodestyle does not support toml in the sense that a [tool.pycodestyle]
# section in a pyproject.toml file is ignored.
# However 'python -m build ...' an sdist writes a setup.cfg file, or if one
# already exists rewrites it ignoring comments and appends some stuff.
# Hence the non-comment content of this setup.cfg survives to provide the
# [pycodestyle] section.

[pycodestyle]
# E203 to fit black formatting and pylint.
# W503 is only default ignore which occurs at 2023-07-14, and style is what
# black formatting does if needed.  My preference is break after operator
# but easier to let black do what it wants.
# E722 is given for 'bare except' even if re-raised but pylint reports
# 'bare-except' only when the exception is not re-raised.
# E402 not added to 'ignore' list because it was possible to get rid of
# the reports without a corresponding 'wrong-import-position' from pylint
# by moving all unconditional imports (two at 2023-07-18) to before the
# conditional imports.
