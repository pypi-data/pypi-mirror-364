# SegUNet weights
Weights of the trained neural network, SegUNet, for HII identification in noisy 21-cm images (segmentation). See [Bianco et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06713) for details.

# SKA-Low Antenna Configuration
The locations of SKAO's low-frequency component (SKA-Low) at different construction stages. See [this link](https://www.skao.int/en/explore/construction-journey) for more information about these stages.

# System Equivalent Flux Density (SEFD) tables
Sensitivity A/T [mÂ²/K] of a single station as a function of frequency. Tables calculated from the [SKAO webtool](http://skalowsensitivitybackup-env.eba-daehsrjt.ap-southeast-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/sensitivity_radec_vs_freq/).

AAVS2 antenna are the (tree like) dipole antenna of SKA-Low station, while the EDA2, as for its predecessor EDA1, consists of 256 MWA bowtie dipoles.
