POD Device Command Reference ðŸ“š
####################################

This page is meant to serve as a reference for all
commands that can be sent to POD devices supported
by Morelia using the :doc:`low-level API </low_level>`. 
**If you haven't read that page, read it first.**

===================
Data Types 101 ðŸ¥—
===================
Every POD device enforces `data types <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type>`_ for the values sent to/recieved
from it. For the uninitiated, these are basically the valid values you are allowed to pass to a specific command. POD devices
use three fundamental data types:

======================= =================== ==============
Type Name               Shorthand Notation  Valid Values
======================= =================== ==============
Unsigned 8-Bit Integer  U8                  [0-255]
Unsigned 16-Bit Integer U16                 [0-65535]
Unsigned 32-Bit Integer U32                 [0-4294967295]

Common Commands
---------------
These commands are common across all POD devices.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: auto

   * - Command Number
     - Command Name
     - Arguments
     - Returns
     - Description

   * - 0
     - ACK
     - None
     - None
     - Basic ACK command. Unused, because in normal communications the sent command is echoed instead.

   * - 1
     - NACK
     - None
     - None
     - Response to an unknown command number.

   * - 2
     - PING
     - None
     - None
     - Used to verify device is present and communicating.

   * - 3
     - RESET
     - None
     - None
     - Indicates a device reset occurred. Also sent at startup.

   * - 7
     - BOOT
     - None
     - None
     - Instructs the device to enter bootload mode. After issuing this command, the bootload process must be completed or the device must be manually reset.

   * - 8
     - TYPE
     - None
     - U8
     - Returns the device type value. This is a unique value for each device. (e.g. is 0x30 for 8206HR).

   * - 12
     - FIRMWARE VERSION
     - None
     - U8, U8, U16
     - Returns the device firmware version as 3 ASCII-encoded hex values. This is, the return values are meant to be intreprated as ASCII, which gives the version number in hexadecimal. Additonally, the U16 encodes two seperate ASCII characters, encoded by the leftmost and rightmost bytes respectively. So 1.0.10 would come back as 0x31, 0x30, 0x00, 0x41 (ASCII for 1.0.A).
