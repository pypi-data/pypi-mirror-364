fixes:
  - |
    Removed the use of ``eval`` in the xprofile middleware. Note that this
    middleware is only intended for development purposes and is not
    intended for use in production systems.

  - |
    Fixed ``Content-Type`` and ``Content-Length`` headers in account and
    container ``HEAD`` responses (with eventlet>=0.38.0).
