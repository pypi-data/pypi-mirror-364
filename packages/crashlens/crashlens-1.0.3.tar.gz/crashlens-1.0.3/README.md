## üß† What is CrashLens?

CrashLens is a developer tool to **analyze GPT API logs** and uncover hidden **token waste**, retry loops, and overkill model usage. It helps you **optimize your OpenAI, Anthropic, or Langfuse API usage** by generating a cost breakdown and **suggesting cost-saving actions**.

#### üîç Use it when you want to:

- Understand how your GPT API budget is being spent
- Reduce unnecessary model calls or retries
- Audit logs for fallback logic inefficiencies
- Analyze Langfuse/OpenAI JSONL logs locally, with full privacy

üßæ Supports: OpenAI, Anthropic, Langfuse JSONL logs  
üíª Platform: 100% CLI, 100% local

---

### üí° Why use CrashLens?

> "You can't optimize what you can't see."
> CrashLens gives you visibility into how you're *actually* using LLMs ‚Äî and how much it's costing you.

---

## üë®‚Äçüíª Use Cases

- Track and reduce monthly OpenAI bills
- Debug retry loops and fallback logic in LangChain or custom agents
- Detect inefficient prompt-to-model usage (e.g., using GPT-4 for 3-token completions)
- Generate token audit logs for compliance or team analysis
- CLI tool to audit GPT usage and optimize OpenAI API costs
- Analyze GPT token usage and efficiency in LLM logs
- Reduce LLM spending with actionable insights

---

## TL;DR

```sh
pip install crashlens
crashlens scan path/to/your-logs.jsonl
# Generates report.md with per-trace waste, cost, and suggestions
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Python Requirement

CrashLens requires **Python 3.12 or higher**. [Download Python 3.12+ here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows PATH Warning

If you see a warning like:

```
WARNING: The script crashlens.exe is installed in 'C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python312\Scripts' which is not on PATH.
Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.
```

This means the `crashlens` command may not work from any folder until you add the above Scripts directory to your system PATH.

**How to fix:**
1. Copy the path shown in the warning (ending with `\Scripts`).
2. Open the Windows Start menu, search for "Environment Variables", and open "Edit the system environment variables".
3. Click "Environment Variables...".
4. Under "User variables" or "System variables", select `Path` and click "Edit".
5. Click "New" and paste the Scripts path.
6. Click OK to save. Restart your terminal/command prompt.

Now you can run `crashlens` from any folder.

## Why CrashLens? (vs. grep + Excel, LangSmith, or basic logging)

- üîÅ **grep + spreadsheet**: Too manual, error-prone, no cost context
- üí∏ **LangSmith**: Powerful but complex, requires full tracing/observability stack
- üîç **Logging without cost visibility**: You miss $ waste and optimization opportunities
- üîí **CrashLens runs 100% locally‚Äîno data leaves your machine.**

---

## Features (Ultra-Specific)

- ‚úÖ Detects retry-loop storms across trace IDs
- ‚úÖ Flags gpt-4, Claude, Gemini, and other expensive model usage where a cheaper model (e.g., gpt-3.5, Claude Instant) would suffice
- ‚úÖ Scans stdin logs from LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom logging
- ‚úÖ Generates Markdown cost reports with per-trace waste

---

## What Makes CrashLens Different?

- üíµ **Model pricing fallback** (auto-detects/corrects missing cost info)
- üîí **Security-by-design** (runs 100% locally, no API calls, no data leaves your machine)
- üö¶ **Coming soon**: Policy enforcement, live CLI firewall, more integrations

---

## üìÑ Log File Structure

**Your logs must be in JSONL format (one JSON object per line) and follow this structure:**

```json
{"traceId": "trace_9",  "startTime": "2025-07-19T10:36:13Z", "input": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "prompt": "How do solar panels work?"}, "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 25, "completion_tokens": 110, "total_tokens": 135}, "cost": 0.000178}
```

- Each line is a separate API call (no commas or blank lines between objects).
- Fields must be nested as shown: `input.model`, `input.prompt`, `usage.completion_tokens`, etc.

**Required fields:**
- `traceId` (string): Unique identifier for a group of related API calls
- `input.model` (string): Model name (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`)
- `input.prompt` (string): The prompt sent to the model
- `usage.completion_tokens` (int): Number of completion tokens used

**Optional fields:**
- `cost` (float): Cost of the API call
- `name`, `startTime`, etc.: Any other metadata

üí° CrashLens expects JSONL with per-call metrics (model, tokens, cost). Works with LangChain logs, OpenAI api.log, Claude, Gemini, and more.

## üöÄ Usage: Command Line Examples

After installation, use the `crashlens` command in your terminal (or `python -m crashlens` if running from source).

### 1. **Scan a log file**
```sh
crashlens scan path/to/your-logs.jsonl
```
- Scans the specified log file and generates a `report.md` in your current directory.

### 2. **Demo mode (built-in sample data)**
```sh
crashlens scan --demo
```
- Runs analysis on built-in example logs (no file needed).

### 3. **Scan from stdin (pipe)**
```sh
cat path/to/your-logs.jsonl | crashlens scan --stdin
```
- Reads logs from standard input (useful for pipelines or quick tests).

### 4. **Paste logs interactively**
```sh
crashlens scan --paste
```
- Allows you to paste log lines directly into the terminal (end input with Ctrl+D).

### 5. **Get help**
```sh
crashlens --help
crashlens scan --help
```
- Shows all available options and usage details.

## üß© Example Workflow

1. **Install CrashLens:**
   ```sh
   pip install crashlens
   # OR clone and install from source as above
   ```
2. **Scan your logs:**
   ```sh
   crashlens scan path/to/your-logs.jsonl
   # OR
   python -m crashlens scan path/to/your-logs.jsonl
   ```
3. **Open `report.md`** in your favorite Markdown viewer or editor to review the findings and suggestions.

## üìù Logging Helper

To make log analysis seamless, you can use our [`crashlens-logger`](https://github.com/Crashlens/logger) package to emit logs in the correct structure for CrashLens. This ensures compatibility and reduces manual formatting.

**Example usage:**
```sh
pip install --upgrade crashlens_logger
```
```python
from crashlens_logger import CrashLensLogger

logger = CrashLensLogger()
logger.log_event(
    traceId=trace_id,
    startTime=start_time,
    endTime=end_time,
    input={"model": model, "prompt": prompt},
    usage=usage
    # Optionally add: type, level, metadata, name, etc.
)
```

- The logger writes each call as a JSONL line in the required format.
- See the [`crashlens-logger` repo](https://github.com/Crashlens/logger) for full docs and advanced usage.

## üÜò Troubleshooting & Tips

- **File not found:** Make sure the path to your log file is correct.
- **No traces found:** Your log file may be empty or not in the expected format.
- **Cost is $0.00:** Check that your log‚Äôs model names match those in the pricing config.
- **Virtual environment issues:** Make sure you‚Äôre using the right Python environment.
- **Need help?** Use `crashlens --help` for all options.
