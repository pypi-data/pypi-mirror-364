Okay, here's a table comparing various window managers, along with links to their homepages.  I've categorized them roughly by "type" (though the lines can blur!), and included a good amount of detail.  This is not exhaustive, as there are *many* window managers, but covers a wide range of popular and interesting choices.  I've also included a "Difficulty" metric, which is subjective, but attempts to gauge how much setup/configuration is typically required.

**Key for Difficulty:**

*   **Easy:** Relatively simple configuration, often with a GUI configuration tool; good for beginners.
*   **Medium:**  Requires some configuration file editing, but well-documented; intermediate users.
*   **Hard:**  Significant configuration file editing, often requires understanding of X11/Wayland concepts; advanced users.
*   **Very Hard:** Expect to spend significant time tweaking, scripting, and potentially coding.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Compositing:**  Compositing provides visual effects like transparency, shadows, and smooth animations.  Window managers without built-in compositing often require a separate compositor (e.g., `picom`, `compton`, `xcompmgr`).
*   **Wayland vs. X11:** Traditionally, most window managers run on the X11 display server protocol.  However, Wayland is a newer protocol that aims to replace X11. Some window managers (like Wayfire, Hyprland, and River) are *specifically* for Wayland, while others (like Mutter, KWin, and XMonad) have Wayland support alongside X11.
*   **Stacking vs. Tiling:**  Stacking managers (like Windows, macOS, Openbox) arrange windows in overlapping layers. Tiling managers (like i3, Awesome, XMonad) arrange windows in non-overlapping tiles, maximizing screen space. Many tiling managers allow for floating windows as well.
*   **Resource Usage:**  Generally, tiling window managers are more resource-efficient than full desktop environments (like GNOME, KDE Plasma, XFCE).  Lightweight stacking managers (like Fluxbox, Openbox) are also relatively efficient.
*   **Configuration:**  The complexity of configuration varies widely. Be prepared to learn a new configuration language (Lua, Haskell, Python, plain text, C code).



**Where to Start?**

*   **Beginners:**  Xfwm4 (if you want a traditional desktop with some customization), Openbox (lightweight and relatively easy to configure), or i3 (for a keyboard-driven tiling experience).
*   **Intermediate:** Awesome, bspwm, Fluxbox
*   **Advanced:** dwm, XMonad, Qtile, Wayfire, Hyprland, River

I recommend reading user reviews and watching videos of each window manager in action before making a decision.  Distro-specific guides can also be very helpful.  Good luck! Let me know if you'd like more detail on any specific window manager.
