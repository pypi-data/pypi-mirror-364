    *   `model.safetensors`: The name of the file you want to download.  You'll need to know the exact filename.  You can find the files in the model repository on the Hugging Face Hub website ([https://huggingface.co/microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T)).  Look under the "Files and versions" tab.  `safetensors` is the preferred format for model weights now.  If it's a `.bin` file, you can download that instead.
    *   `--local-dir ./bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T`:  The directory to save the file to.

*   **Download using `transformers` library (recommended for most use cases):**

    The `transformers` library provides a convenient way to download and cache models.  This is often the easiest approach if you're using the model with `transformers`.  You don't *directly* use the `huggingface-cli` for this, but it's worth knowing.

    ```python
    from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

    model_name = "microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T"

    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

    # The model and tokenizer will be downloaded and cached in your
    # transformers cache directory (usually ~/.cache/huggingface/transformers).
    ```

    This approach automatically handles downloading the necessary files and caching them for future use.  It also handles the correct file formats and configurations.

**4.  Checking the Download**

After the download completes, verify that the files are in the specified directory.  You can use `ls` (Linux/macOS) or `dir` (Windows) to list the contents of the directory.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Disk Space:**  The `bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T` model is quite large (several gigabytes).  Make sure you have enough free disk space before downloading.
*   **Network Connection:**  A stable and fast internet connection is essential for a smooth download.
*   **Caching:** The Hugging Face Hub and `transformers` library use caching to avoid re-downloading models unnecessarily.  The default cache directory is usually `~/.cache/huggingface/transformers`.
*   **File Formats:**  Models are often stored in `safetensors` or `.bin` formats.  `safetensors` is generally preferred for security and performance.
*   **Model Card:**  Always read the model card on the Hugging Face Hub ([https://huggingface.co/microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T)) for important information about the model, its intended use, limitations, and potential biases.
*   **Gated Models:** Some models require you to accept terms of use before you can download them.  The `huggingface-cli login` command will guide you through this process if necessary.

**Example Workflow (Recommended):**

1.  `huggingface-cli login` (if not already logged in)
2.  Use the `transformers` library in a Python script to download and load the model (as shown in the example above).  This is the most convenient and reliable method for most use cases.
