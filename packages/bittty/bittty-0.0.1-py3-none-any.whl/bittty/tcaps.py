"""
The Terminal Capability Database.

This module provides the `Terminal` class, which is responsible for loading
and providing access to terminal capabilities from the system's terminfo
database.

In this emulator architecture, its primary role is NOT for display. Instead,
it serves two main purposes:
1.  **Input Emulation**: It provides the correct key codes to send to the
    child application (e.g., the byte sequence for the F1 key or arrow keys).
2.  **Feature Flags**: It tells the parser and screen writer about terminal
    features (e.g., does this terminal support auto-margins?).

It does NOT generate ANSI escape codes for screen drawing; that task is
delegated to the Textual renderer.
