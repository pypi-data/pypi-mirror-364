# Cisco NSO MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for [Cisco NSO (Network Services Orchestrator)](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/networking/software/crosswork-network-services-orchestrator/index.html) that exposes NSO data and operations as MCP primitives (Tools, Resources, etc.) that can be consumed by an [MCP-compatible client](#connecting-to-the-server-with-mcp-clients), enabling AI-powered network automation through natural language interactions.

## Sample Custom Client

## What is MCP?

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that standardizes how AI models interact with external tools and services. MCP enables:

- **Tool Definition**: Structured way to define tools that AI models can use
- **Tool Discovery**: Mechanism for models to discover available tools
- **Tool Execution**: Standardized method for models to call tools and receive results
- **Context Management**: Efficient passing of context between tools and models
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works across multiple AI frameworks including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and others
- **Interoperability**: Provides a common language for AI systems to communicate with external tools

## Features

- **Stdio Transport**: By default, this MCP server uses stdio transport for process-bound communication
- **Tool-First Design**: Network operations are defined as discrete tools with clear interfaces
- **Asynchronous Processing**: All network operations are implemented asynchronously for better performance
- **Structured Responses**: Consistent response format with status, data, and metadata sections
- **Environment Resources**: Provides contextual information about the NSO environment
- **NSO Integration**: Uses [cisco-nso-restconf](https://github.com/dbono711/cisco-nso-restconf) library for a clean, Pythonic interface to NSO's RESTCONF API
- **Flexible Logging**: Configurable logging to stdout and/or file via environment variables. When the `LOG_FILE` environment variable is set, logs are sent to both stdout and the specified file. If the log file cannot be created or written to, the server falls back to stdout-only logging with an error message
- **Multiple Client Support**: Works with any MCP-compatible client including Windsurf Cascade and custom Python applications

## Configuration Options

You can configure the server using command-line arguments or environment variables:

### NSO Connection Parameters

| Command-line Argument | Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|----------------------|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `--nso-scheme`       | `NSO_SCHEME`        | http    | NSO connection scheme (http/https) |
| `--nso-address`      | `NSO_ADDRESS`       | localhost | NSO server address |
| `--nso-port`         | `NSO_PORT`          | 8080    | NSO server port |
| `--nso-timeout`      | `NSO_TIMEOUT`       | 10      | Connection timeout in seconds |
| `--nso-username`     | `NSO_USERNAME`      | admin   | NSO username |
| `--nso-password`     | `NSO_PASSWORD`      | admin   | NSO password |

### MCP Server Parameters

| Command-line Argument | Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|----------------------|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `--transport`        | `MCP_TRANSPORT`     | stdio   | MCP transport type (stdio/sse) |

### SSE Transport Options (only used when --transport=sse) (IN DEVELOPMENT)

| Command-line Argument | Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|----------------------|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `--host`             | `MCP_HOST`          | 0.0.0.0 | Host to bind to when using SSE transport |
| `--port`             | `MCP_PORT`          | 8000    | Port to bind to when using SSE transport |

### Logging Configuration

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `LOG_FILE`          | None    | Path to log file. If not set, logs will be sent to stdout only |

Environment variables take precedence over default values but are overridden by command-line arguments.

## Connecting to the Server with MCP Clients

You can connect to the server using any MCP client that supports the selected transport type. A few options are:

### Windsurf Cascade

Windsurf Cascade [supports MCP servers](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp#model-context-protocol-mcp) through a configuration file. To use the Cisco NSO MCP server with Windsurf, add it to your `mcp_config.json` file.

#### Using uv (recommended)

When using uv, no specific installation is needed. You can use `uvx` to directly run the package:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nso": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "cisco-nso-mcp-server",
        "--nso-address=127.0.0.1",
        "--nso-port=8080",
        "--nso-username=admin",
        "--nso-password=admin"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LOG_FILE": "/path/to/your/logs/nso-mcp.log"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using with pip installation

Alternatively, you can install `cisco-nso-mcp-server` via pip:

```bash
pip install cisco-nso-mcp-server
```

Now you can use the direct path to the executable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nso": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/env/bin/cisco-nso-mcp-server",
      "args": [
        "--nso-address=127.0.0.1",
        "--nso-port=8080",
        "--nso-username=admin",
        "--nso-password=admin"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LOG_FILE": "/path/to/your/logs/nso-mcp.log"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/your/env/bin/cisco-nso-mcp-server` with the actual path where you [installed the package with pip](#using-with-pip-installation). You can find this by running `which cisco-nso-mcp-server` if you installed it in your main environment, or by locating it in your virtual environment's bin directory.

In either case, the `env` section is optional. If you include it, you can specify the `LOG_FILE` environment variable to enable file logging.

### Using in a custom MCP client Python application with stdio transport

A sample Python application is provided in [sample_stdio_client.py](./sample_stdio_client.py) that demonstrates how to connect to the MCP server locally and execute a tool.

## Running the Server as Standalone

While the server is typically used with an [MCP client](#connecting-to-the-server-with-mcp-clients), you can also run it directly as a standalone process:

```bash
# Run with default NSO connection and MCP settings (see Configuration Options above for details)
cisco-nso-mcp-server

# Run with custom NSO connection parameters
cisco-nso-mcp-server --nso-address 192.168.1.100 --nso-port 8888 --nso-username myuser --nso-password mypass
```

When running as a standalone process with stdio transport, you'll need to pipe input/output to the process or use it with an MCP client that supports stdio transport.
