Subject: Refund for 3 Solar Modules (Order Number: ST-78901)

Dear SolarTech Team,

I ordered three solar modules of the EcoSun 400 type from you on April 5th of this year (Order Number: ST-78901). Unfortunately, I now have to ask for a refund as my situation has unexpectedly changed.

Shortly after my order, I was transferred to another city by my employer. Therefore, I have to move from Munich to Hamburg in the coming months and cannot install the solar system as planned. The modules are still in their original packaging and have not been unpacked or used.

I know that according to your website, there is a 30-day return policy, but unfortunately, 40 days have passed since my order. I hope that you can make an exception in this case, as the circumstances were beyond my control.

Could you please let me know if a return and refund would be possible in my case? If so, how would the process work? Are there ways to return the modules without incurring high shipping costs?

I deeply regret causing you this inconvenience, but I would be very grateful for your understanding and a accommodating solution.

Kind regards,
Max Mustermann

Subject: Re: Refund for 3 Solar Modules (Order Number: ST-78901)

Dear Mr. Mustermann,

Thank you for your email regarding the refund of your recently purchased solar modules. First, I would like to thank you for your trust in SolarTech and your interest in renewable energy. I'm sorry to hear that you need to request a refund due to your unexpected transfer from Munich to Hamburg.

I can well understand that a job transfer and the associated move have disrupted your plans to install a solar system. Such changes are often challenging, and I want to assure you that we will do our best to accommodate you in this situation.

Let me first explain our standard return policies: As you correctly mentioned, we normally allow a 30-day return period for unused products in original packaging. In your case, 40 days have passed since the purchase, which would usually mean that a return is no longer possible.

However, at SolarTech, we understand that there are sometimes exceptional circumstances that justify an exception. Given your situation and the fact that the modules are still in their original packaging and unused, I would like to offer you the following goodwill solution:

We are willing to take back the three EcoSun 400 modules and refund you the purchase price minus a small processing fee of 5%. This fee covers our costs for the return and re-inspection of the modules.

The process for the return and refund would be as follows:

1. You confirm to us by email that you agree to the return and the conditions.
2. We organize a pickup service that will collect the modules from you. You will not incur any additional costs for this.
3. Once the modules have arrived at our warehouse, we will conduct a quality inspection.
4. After successful inspection, we will initiate the refund to the payment method you used for the purchase.
5. The entire process usually takes 10-14 working days from the time of pickup.

Before you decide on a return, however, I would like to suggest some alternative options:

1. Installation at the new location: Perhaps there is a possibility to install the solar modules at your new location in Hamburg? Our EcoSun 400 modules are very flexible in use and could potentially lead to significant energy savings there as well.

2. Storage for later use: If you plan to move into your own house again in the future, you could also store the modules. They have a long lifespan, and their efficiency remains intact for many years.

3. Partial return: If you have less space for solar modules at your new location, we could also arrange a partial return and refund you for only one or two modules.

I would like to encourage you to continue considering the benefits of solar energy. Solar systems not only offer significant savings in energy costs but also contribute substantially to environmental protection. The technology is constantly evolving, and the efficiency of the modules is continuously increasing. Even if you decide to return now, a solar system could be an excellent investment for you in the future.

To discuss all your options in detail and clarify any further questions, I would like to offer you a phone call. Please let me know if you are interested and at what time I can best reach you.

In conclusion, I would like to thank you again for your understanding and patience. At SolarTech, we place great value on customer satisfaction, and we want to ensure that we find the best possible solution for you.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am always at your disposal.
