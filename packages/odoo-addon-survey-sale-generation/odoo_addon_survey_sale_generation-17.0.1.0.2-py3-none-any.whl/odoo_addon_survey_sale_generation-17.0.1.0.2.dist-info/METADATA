Configuration
=============

You can configure either a new or an existing survey.

1. Go to *Surveys* and choose an existing one or create it.
2. In the *Options* tab, *Sales* group, set *Generate Quotations* on.
3. You can set your preferred sales team for the generated quotations.

Now you'll have to configure the products linked to the questions.

For *Numerical value* questions:

1. In the *Answers* tab choose the linked products.
2. The resulting quotation will have as many items of that products as
   the user defines.

For *Multiple choice: only one answer*:

1. In the *Answers* tab link multiple products to every given choice.
2. The resulting quotation will have the products linked to the survey
   user's choice.

For *Multiple choice: multiple answers allowed*:

1. In the *Answers* tab link products to every given choice.
2. The resulting quotation will have the products linked to the survey
   user's choices.
3. By default a unit of product will be added per answer to the
   quotation. If you want to set a variable choice, you can link a
   numeric question that will act as multiplier.

When the survey is submited an internal message is generated in the
resulting quotation with a link to the user answers. Optionally, you can
configure some of the questions so their input values are shown in such
message. This way it can be easier to track some relevant infos
concerning the request. To do so:

1. In the *Options* tab of the questions go to the *Sales* section.
2. Set *Show in sale order comment* on if you want those answers on the
   internal notification.

If you want the generated quotation to use a quotation template you can
either:

- Choose it from the general survey options: *Sale Order Template*.
- In a single answer question, choose set the quotation depending on the
  answer.

The answer value will prevail over the general option.

You can also configure the survey to send the quotation to the customer
by mail. When doing so, you can choose a mail template or use the
default one.

If you want to fill sale fields from the answers:

1. In the *Options* tab of the questions go to the *Sales* section.
2. Set *Sale the sale field* you want to fill with the given answer.

Usage
=====

Once the survey is configured, the users can fill them up as usual. The
quotations will be generated according to the survey users' choices.
