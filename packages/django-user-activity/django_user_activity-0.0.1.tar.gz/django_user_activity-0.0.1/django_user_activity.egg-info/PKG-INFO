## Activity Model
The `Activity` model contains the following fields:

  `user`: The user who performed the action. <br>

  `url`: The URL visited by the user. <br>

  `referer`: The referer tells you which page the user is coming from. If its value is `None`, it means the user hits the url directly in the browser. <br>

  `method`: The HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST). <br>

  `ip`: The ip of user's device. <br>
