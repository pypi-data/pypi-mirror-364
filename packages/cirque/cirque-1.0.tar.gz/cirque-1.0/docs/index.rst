CIRQUE (Communication Interface to Readout system for QUantum Experiments) is the python based based user client to control our hardware systems.
It wraps the grpc calls implemented into our system into a user-friendly package that can be imported into higher-level projects.
The grpc-calls are used to configure the systems and acquire measurement result or other information about the system status.
