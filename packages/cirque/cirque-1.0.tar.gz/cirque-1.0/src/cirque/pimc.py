        - All clocks connected to the PIMC have to be in the valid range.
          Status of the clocks can be monitored by calling
          :func:`~firmware_modules.pimc.PIMC.GetClockInfo`

        - The busy signal of the platform needs to be zero.

          :func:`~firmware_modules.pimc.PIMC.GetBusy`
        - The software-ready flag needs to be activated.
          See :func:`~firmware_modules.pimc.PIMC.SetSWReady`.
