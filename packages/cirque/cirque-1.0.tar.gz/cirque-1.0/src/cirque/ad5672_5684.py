    This Plugin offers control of a set of mostly similar, simple DACs.
    These are Analog Devices' AD5672, AD5684 and possibly some others,
    which are all commonly integrated as chips on PCBs.

    Each Endpoint corresponds to one chip, which contains multiple channels
    (AD5672: 8, AD5684: 4). This plugin offers support for either setting a
    specific 12-bit register value [0...4095], which corresponds to an output
    voltage of [0..5V], or directly setting the desired voltage.

    Further details can be found on a chip's data-sheet
