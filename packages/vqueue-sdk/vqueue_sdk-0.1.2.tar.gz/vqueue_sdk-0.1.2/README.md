# Virtual Queue Python SDK

SDK to communicate with Virtual Queue's API in Python projects.

## How to use

> [!NOTE]
> See more examples [here](https://github.com/animus-coop/virtual-queue-python-sdk/tree/main/examples), including an example of how to use this SDK inside a Flask application

You can verify the token with `TokenVerifier` like this:

```python
from vqueue import TokenVerifier
from vqueue.exceptions import VQueueApiError, VQueueError, VQueueNetworkError


def your_function_or_handler():
    # Get the token from the request in your system
    token = str(uuid4())  # This is an example UUIDv4

    # This handles the connections with a session and can be reused
    # for better performance
    verifier = TokenVerifier()

    try:
        # Handle the happy path
        verified_result = verifier.verify_token(token)
        print("The token was successfuly verified:", verified_result)
    except ValueError as ve:
        # Then handle the possible errors
        # Of course, you should handle the exceptions with more grace than this
        print("The token is not valir UUID", ve)
    except VQueueNetworkError as ne:
        print("Network error", ne)
    except VQueueApiError as ae:
        print("The API returned an error status", ae)
    except VQueueError as vqe:
        print("A generic error with the Virtual Queue system or this SDK", vqe)
```

You can also wrap your code in a context managed `with` block:

```python
    with TokenVerifier() as verfifier:
        try:
            # Handle the happy path
            verified_result = verifier.verify_token(token)
            print("The token was successfuly verified:", verified_result)
        except ValueError as ve:
            # Then handle the possible errors
            # Of course, you should handle the exceptions with more grace than this
            print("The token is not valir UUID", ve)
        except VQueueNetworkError as ne:
            print("Network error", ne)
        except VQueueApiError as ae:
            print("The API returned an error status", ae)
        except VQueueError as vqe:
            print("A generic error with the Virtual Queue system or this SDK", vqe)
```
