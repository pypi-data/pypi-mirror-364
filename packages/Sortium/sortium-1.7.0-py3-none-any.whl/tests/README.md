# 🧪 `sortium` Test Suite

This directory contains a complete suite of tests for the `sortium` Python library—a utility for organizing and sorting files in parallel.

The test suite ensures correctness, robustness, and graceful handling of errors across the library's core features, including parallel file operations, recursive file scanning, and name collision avoidance.

## 📁 Directory Overview

```

## ✅ What’s Tested

### `test_sorter.py`

Tests the `Sorter` class, which is responsible for the main file organization logic.

*   **`sort_by_type()`**
    *   Correctly categorizes files into folders like `Images`, `Documents`, etc.
    *   Successfully sorts files to a **separate destination directory**.
    *   Gracefully handles **file name collisions** by creating unique names (e.g., `file (1).txt`).
    *   Raises `FileNotFoundError` for invalid source paths.

*   **`sort_by_date()`**
    *   Sorts files within existing category folders into date-stamped subfolders (e.g., `01-Jan-2023`).
    *   Verifies correct placement of files within the new date folders.
    *   Skips non-existent category folders without error.

*   **`sort_by_regex()`**
    *   Performs **recursive** scanning to find matching files in nested directories.
    *   Categorizes files based on complex regex patterns.
    *   Verifies that files from deep subdirectories are correctly moved.

---

### `test_file_utils.py`

Tests the `FileUtils` class and its helper functions, which provide the building blocks for file system operations.

*   **File Iterators (`iter_shallow_files` & `iter_all_files_recursive`)**
    *   Verifies that the generators yield the correct files.
    *   Confirms that `ignore_dir` properly excludes specified directories.
    *   Ensures recursive iteration correctly traverses the entire directory tree.

*   **`flatten_dir()`**
    *   Moves all files from a nested directory structure into a single destination folder.
    *   Correctly respects the `ignore_dir` parameter.
    *   Raises `FileNotFoundError` for invalid source paths.

*   **`find_unique_extensions()`**
    *   Accurately detects and returns all unique file extensions from a directory tree.
    *   Validates that ignored directories are excluded from the scan.

*   **Helper Functions**
    *   Tests `get_file_modified_date()` for correctness.
    *   Validates the name collision logic in `_generate_unique_path()`.

## 🧪 Primary Test Fixture: `file_tree`

To ensure consistent and isolated tests, a primary fixture named `file_tree` is defined in `conftest.py`. It creates a temporary directory with a standard nested structure for most tests to use.

```
<tmp_path>/
├── empty_dir/
├── sub_dir/
│   ├── nested_image.png
│   ├── nested_doc.pdf
│   └── deep_dir/
│       └── deep_archive.zip
├── ignore_this_dir/
│   └── secret.txt
├── main_image.jpg
├── main_doc.txt
├── main_archive.rar
├── script.py
└── data_report_2023.csv
```

This structure allows tests to validate shallow scanning, deep recursion, and directory exclusion logic using a single, reliable setup.

## ➕ Adding New Tests

To extend the test suite, follow these steps:

### 1. **Pick the Right File**

| If you are testing...    | Add your test to...      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `Sorter` class logic     | `test_sorter.py`         |
| `FileUtils` or helpers   | `test_file_utils.py`     |
| New shared fixtures      | `conftest.py`            |

### 2. **Write a Test Function**

Create a new function starting with `test_`. Use the `file_tree` fixture or create a new one if a different structure is needed.

```python
# In test_sorter.py
def test_new_feature_moves_files(sorter_instance, file_tree):
    # 1. Call the function you are testing
    sorter_instance.new_feature(str(file_tree))
    
    # 2. Assert that the outcome is what you expect
    assert (file_tree / "New_Category" / "script.py").is_file()
    assert not (file_tree / "script.py").exists()
```

### 3. **Create a Fixture (If Needed)**

If your test requires a unique file structure, add a new fixture in `conftest.py`.

```python
# In conftest.py
@pytest.fixture
def custom_tree(tmp_path):
    (tmp_path / "file-01.log").touch()
    (tmp_path / "file-02.log").touch()
    return tmp_path
```

## 🧪 Running the Tests

First, ensure you have `pytest` and `pytest-cov` (for coverage reporting) installed:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov
```

From the root directory of the project, run one of the following commands:

**Run all tests:**
```bash
pytest
```

**Run tests with a coverage report:**
```bash
pytest --cov=sortium
```

---

## 📦 Note

All tests are designed to be completely isolated. They operate exclusively within temporary directories created and automatically destroyed by `pytest`, ensuring that no changes are made to your actual file system.
