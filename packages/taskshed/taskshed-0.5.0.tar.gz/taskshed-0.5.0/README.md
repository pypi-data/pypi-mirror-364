# TaskShed 🛖

`taskshed` is a performant, asynchronous task scheduling framework built with Python's `asyncio`. It allows you to schedule one-off or recurring (interval) coroutine tasks, with a modular architecture that separates execution, scheduling, and data storage.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Asynchronous execution and storage via `asyncio`.
- 📦 Schedule, update and remove multiple tasks in a single database transaction.
- 🙋‍♂️ Attach (indexable) groups to tasks, allowing for easy user-based management.
- ⏰ Supports both one-time (`date`) and recurring (`interval`) tasks.
- 🧱 Pluggable data stores (e.g. in-memory, MySQL and Redis)
