LONG_DESCRIPTION = '''A package to access SyMetrics database. 
SYMETRICS database is a consolidation of metrics for synonymous variants which were derived from a number of computational tools each of which contributing to 
attribute specific metrics such as synVEP for general functional constraints, spliceAI for splicing effect, SILVA for obtaining GERP++ (phylogenetic related constraints)
CpG/CpG_Exon, dRSCU/RSCU for codon usage and SURF for rna stability. The package also includes a result of the analysis of the influence of each variants exceeding set threshold
per metrics defined constituting to a score assigned to a gene'''
