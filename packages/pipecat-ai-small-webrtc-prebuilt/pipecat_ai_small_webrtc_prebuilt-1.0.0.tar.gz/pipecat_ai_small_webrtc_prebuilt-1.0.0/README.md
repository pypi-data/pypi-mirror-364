   ```

## ðŸš€ Publishing

- Prepare to dist:
```shell
./scripts/prepare_dist.sh
```

- Test the build using TestPyPI with Twine:

Upload to TestPyPI using twine
```shell
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

Uninstall previous production version
```shell
pip uninstall pipecat-ai-small-webrtc-prebuilt
```

Test using pip to download packages from TestPyPI instead of PyPI
```shell
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ pipecat-ai-small-webrtc-prebuilt
```

Double check version
```shell
pip list |grep pipecat-ai-small-webrtc-prebuilt
```

Run test...

Once you are happy, publish it to production.
```shell
twine upload dist/*
```

Profit.
