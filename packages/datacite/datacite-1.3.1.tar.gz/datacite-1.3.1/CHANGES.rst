Changes
=======

Version v1.3.1 (released 2025-07-23):

- remove deprecated schema 31 test files
- tests: reorganize test files and remove http schema access that was removed in lxml
- fix: replaced pkg_resources with importlib.resources

Version v1.3.0 (released 2025-07-03):

- Removes deprecated schema 3.1
- Adds minimum python version 3.9
- Switches 4.5 schema to https
- Documentation clanup and improvements

Version v1.2.0 (released 2024-10-17):

- Updates package setup and adds black formatting
- Adds support for DataCite Metadata Schema v4.5.
  The version 4.5 jsonschema includes a number of 
  changes and improvements:

  - Switches to jsonschema 2019-09 and adds more complete validation
    to catch mistyped elements
  - Switches publisher from a string to an object. This means
    you will need to change publisher to be structured like 
    `"publisher": {"name": "Invenio Software"}` 
    when you use version 4.5. This change is needed to
    support the addition of publisher identifiers.
  - Removes the identifiers field and added doi, prefix, and suffix fields.
    These fields are clearer, and DataCite appears to be moving away from the
    combined identifiers field. doi is not a required field since you may or
    may not have a DOI depending on your workflow.
  - Adds new relatedItem elements for publication metadata
  - Switches geolocation point values to numbers. This is to enable 
    validation and is consistent with GeoJson and InvenioRDM. It is 
    different from the DataCite REST API which uses strings, and
    submitted numbers will be turned into strings by DataCite.
  - Reorganizes geolocationPolygon to how DataCite is currently rendering this
    metadata
  - Adds support for the new resourceTypeGeneral and relationType values
  - General jsonschema organization improvements

  - "contributorName" is now "name"
