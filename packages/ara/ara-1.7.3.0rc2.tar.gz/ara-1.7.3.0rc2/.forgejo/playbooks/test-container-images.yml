# Note: If anything fails above, this will not run because we can't wrap playbook imports in a block/rescue.
# That's why before creating a new VM we check if there's any old VM and delete them before running a new job.
# In other words: the intent is to delete the VM immediately on success but leave it up for troubleshooting
# if it fails, up to a specified timeout.
