# terraformreviewer: AI-Powered Terraform Documentation and Comment Generator

`terraformreviewer` is a command-line tool that uses Anthropic’s Claude AI to automatically generate production-ready documentation (`README.md`) and add clear, helpful inline comments to your Terraform (`.tf`) files. This makes your infrastructure-as-code projects easier to understand, maintain, and onboard new team members.

---

## Features

- **Automatic README Generation:** Produces a comprehensive, human-readable `README.md` for your Terraform project.
- **Inline Comments:** Adds concise, informative comments to all `.tf` files, explaining resources, blocks, and configuration.
- **Powered by Claude AI:** Leverages Anthropic’s Claude for high-quality, context-aware documentation and code explanations.

---

## Installation

Install the tool directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install terraformreviewer
```

Or, if you want the latest development version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zayan-ahmed953/Terraform_Reviewer_AI_Tool.git
cd Terraform_AI_Reviewer
pip install -e .
```

---

## Setup

Before using the tool, you must set your Anthropic API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your valueapi key>
```

You can obtain an API key from [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/quickstart-guide).

---

## Usage

Run the tool from your terminal, pointing it to your Terraform project directory:

```bash
terraformreviewer /path/to/your/terraform/project
```

This will:
- Generate a `README.md` describing your infrastructure.
- Add helpful inline comments to all `.tf` files in the project.

**Example:**

```bash
terraformreviewer /home/zayan/Desktop/My-Projects/AI-Generated-sample-terraform/
```

---

## Notes

- If you rerun the tool without changing your Terraform files, it will skip regeneration for efficiency.
- Ensure your API key is valid and you have internet access.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No .tf files found:** Make sure you provide the path to a directory containing Terraform files.
- **API key error:** Double-check that `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in your environment.
- **Other errors:** Please open an issue with the error message and steps to reproduce.
