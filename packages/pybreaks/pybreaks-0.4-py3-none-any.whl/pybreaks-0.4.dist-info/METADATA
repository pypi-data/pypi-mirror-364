Detection and correction of structural breaks in (climate) time series.

Description
===========

This package currently includes methods to test for inhomogeneities in satellite soil moisture measurements.
In also contains implementations for correcting detected breaks, currently there are three methods:

- Linear Model Pair matching
- Higher Order Moment adjustment (see also https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI3855.1)
- Quantile Category Matching (see also https://doi.org/10.1175/2010JAMC2376.1)

The main modules in the package are:

- ``TsRelBreakTest`` : Implements relative statistical tests between two subperiods to detect a break between them.
- ``RegressPairFit``, ``HigherOrderMoments``, ``QuantileCatMatch`` : Classes that implement the correction methods.
- ``TsRelBreakAdjust`` : Combines the detection and correction methods to correct a break between two subperiods.
- ``TsRelMultiBreak`` : Iterates over multiples breaks in a time series to correct them.
