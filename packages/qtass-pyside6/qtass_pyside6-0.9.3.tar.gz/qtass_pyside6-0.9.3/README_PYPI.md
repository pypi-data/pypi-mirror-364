This is the Python version of the [Qt Advanced Stylesheets Project](https://github.com/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Stylesheets) for C++.

The library allows runtime color switching for CSS stylesheet themes including
SVG resources and SVG icons. The image below shows switching of accent color
and switching between dark and light theme. Notice how the icons in the left 
sidebar change color when switching between dark and light theme.
