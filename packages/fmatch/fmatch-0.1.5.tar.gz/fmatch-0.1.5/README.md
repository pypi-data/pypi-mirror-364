## Notes
For each release of the fmatch package, it is imperative to update the version in the setup.py file located in the base directory. This practice ensures a smooth publishing process on PyPI, mitigating potential conflicts. PyPI imposes restrictions on re-publishing a package with the same version, even if it has been deleted from the repository. Therefore, maintaining accurate versioning in the setup.py file is essential for hassle-free PyPI publication.
