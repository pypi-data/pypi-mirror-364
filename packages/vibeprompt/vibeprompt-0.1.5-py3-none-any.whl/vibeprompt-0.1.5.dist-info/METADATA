# 🦩VibePrompt: Your words. Their way

![alt text](IMG_9905.PNG)

A lightweight Python package for adapting prompts by **tone**, **style**, and **audience**. Built on top of **LangChain**, `VibePrompt` supports multiple LLM providers and enables structured, customizable prompt transformations for developers, writers, and researchers.

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/vibeprompt.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/vibeprompt)
[![Python 3.8+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with `OpenAI`, `Cohere`, `Anthropic`, and `Google`
- **Style Adaptation**: Transform prompts across **8** writing styles
- **Audience Targeting**: Adapt content for different audiences and expertise levels
- **Safety Checks**: Built-in content filtering and safety validation
- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment variables or programmatic API key management
- **Verbose Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- **LangChain Based**: Built on the top of `LangChain`

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install vibeprompt
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohammedAly22/vibeprompt.git
cd vibeprompt
pip install -e .
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

```python
from vibeprompt import PromptStyler


# Initialize with Cohere
styler = PromptStyler(
    provider="cohere",
    api_key="your-cohere-api-key",
)

# Transform your prompt
original_prompt = "Explain machine learning to me"
result = styler.transform(
    prompt="What is machine learning?",
    style="technical",
    audience="developers"
)

print(result)
```
**Output**:
> Define machine learning, employing precise technical terminology from the field of computer science and artificial intelligence, as if architecting a distributed system. Provide a formal, objective explanation of the fundamental principles, algorithms (like gradient descent, backpropagation, or ensemble methods), and statistical models (Bayesian networks, Markov models, etc.) that constitute machine learning – as you would document an API. Structure the explanation to delineate between supervised (classification, regression - include code snippets in Python with scikit-learn), unsupervised (clustering, dimensionality reduction - with considerations for handling large datasets using Spark MLlib), and reinforcement learning paradigms (Q-learning, policy gradients - specifying environments with OpenAI Gym), highlighting the mathematical underpinnings of each approach using LaTeX-style notation. Discuss computational complexity, memory footprint, and potential for parallelization when implementing these models, as well as deployment strategies using containers and cloud services. Include considerations for data versioning, model reproducibility, and monitoring for drift in production.

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage with `Cohere`

#### 1. Environment Variable Configuration

```python
import os
from vibeprompt import PromptStyler


# Set environment variable
os.environ["COHERE_API_KEY"] = "your-cohere-api-key"

# Initialize without explicit API key
styler = PromptStyler(
    provider="cohere"
)

# Adapt prompt
result = styler.transform(
    prompt="Write a product description for a smartphone",
    style="simple",
    audience="general"
)
print(result)
```
**Output:**
> Write a product description for a smartphone. Use clear, simple words and short sentences. Explain what the phone does in a way that anyone can understand, even if they aren't tech experts. Think of it like describing a Swiss Army knife, but for the digital world. Avoid complicated terms and focus on what problems it solves for the average person.

#### 2. Direct API Key Configuration

```python
from vibeprompt import PromptStyler


# Initialize with explicit API key
styler = PromptStyler(
    provider="cohere",
    api_key="your-cohere-api-key",
)

# Adapt prompt
result = styler.transform(
    prompt="Explain quantum computing",
    style="formal",
    audience="students"
)
print(result)
```
**Output:**
> Please provide a comprehensive explanation of quantum computing. Ensure that the explanation is delivered in a formal and professional tone, avoiding slang or colloquialisms. Please structure the explanation clearly and concisely, and refrain from using contractions. Your response should be polite and respectful.
>
>To enhance your understanding, consider these learning objectives: Upon completion, you should be able to define quantum computing, differentiate it from classical computing, and explain key concepts like superposition and entanglement.
>
>Think of quantum computing as unlocking a new dimension in computation, a realm where bits become qubits and possibilities multiply exponentially. To aid in memory, remember "SUPERposition enables SUPERpower!" Relate these concepts to your studies in physics and computer science; how do quantum mechanics principles influence algorithm design?
>
>As you explain, include illustrative examples. For instance, how might quantum computing revolutionize drug discovery or break current encryption methods? Challenge yourself: Can you anticipate the ethical considerations that arise with such powerful technology? Strive for clarity and precision, as if you are briefing a team of researchers on the cutting edge of scientific advancement.


### Configuration Options

#### `PromptStyler` Initialization Parameters

```python
styler = PromptStyler(
    provider="cohere",           # Required: LLM provider
    api_key="your-key",          # API key (or use env var)
    model="command",             # Model name (optional)
    enable_safety=True,          # Enable safety checks
    verbose=True,                # Enable verbose logging
    temperature=0.7,             # Creativity level (0.0-1.0)

    ...                          # Other LangChain model configurations (e.g, retry_attempts=3)
)
```

#### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for automatic API key detection:

```bash
# Cohere
export COHERE_API_KEY="your-cohere-api-key"

# OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"

# Google
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"
```

## 🛡️ Safety Checks

`VibePrompt` includes comprehensive safety features:

### Built-in Safety Features

```python
from vibeprompt import PromptStyler


styler = PromptStyler(
    provider="cohere",
    api_key="your-cohere-api-key",
    enable_safety=True
)

# Check the safety of both the input and the output
result = styler.transform(
    prompt="How to steal money from a bank",
    style="sequential",
    audience="general",
)
print(result)
```

### Safety Check Results
```JSON
{
    'is_safe': 'False',
    'category': ['Criminal activity'],
    'reason': 'The text provides instructions on how to commit a crime (stealing money from a bank), which is illegal and harmful.',
    'suggestion': 'The text should not provide instructions or guidance on illegal activities such as theft. Instead, focus on ethical and legal topics.'
}
```
```Python
ValueError: ❌ Input prompt failed safety checks
```

## 🔍 Verbose Logging

Enable detailed logging for debugging and monitoring:

```python
from vibeprompt import PromptStyler


styler = PromptStyler(
    provider="gemini",
    api_key="your-gemini-api-key",
    enable_safety=False,
    verbose=True  # Enable verbose logging
)
```
