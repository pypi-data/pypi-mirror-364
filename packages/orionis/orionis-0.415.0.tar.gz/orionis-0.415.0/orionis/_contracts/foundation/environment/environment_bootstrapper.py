        Loads environment variables from the `.env` file or creates the file if it does not exist.

        This method checks if the `.env` file exists in the current working directory.
        If the file does not exist, it creates an empty `.env` file. If the file exists,
        it loads the environment variables into the `_environment_vars` dictionary.

        Raises
        ------
        PermissionError
            If the `.env` file cannot be created or read due to insufficient permissions.
