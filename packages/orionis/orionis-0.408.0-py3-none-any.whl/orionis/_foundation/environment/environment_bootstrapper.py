class EnvironmentBootstrapper(IEnvironmentBootstrapper):
    """
    A class responsible for loading and managing environment variables from a `.env` file.

    This class implements the `IEnvironment` interface and provides functionality to
    automatically load environment variables from a `.env` file located in the current
    working directory. If the file does not exist, it creates it.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _environment_vars : Dict[str, str]
        A dictionary to store the loaded environment variables.
    path : Path
        The path to the `.env` file.

    Methods
    -------
    __init__()
        Initializes the `EnvironmentBootstrapper` and triggers the autoload process.
    _autoload()
        Loads environment variables from the `.env` file or creates the file if it does not exist.
    """

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """
        Initializes the `EnvironmentBootstrapper` and triggers the autoload process.

        The `_environment_vars` dictionary is initialized to store environment variables,
        and the `_autoload` method is called to load variables from the `.env` file.
        """

        """
        Loads environment variables from the `.env` file or creates the file if it does not exist.

        This method checks if the `.env` file exists in the current working directory.
        If the file does not exist, it creates an empty `.env` file. If the file exists,
        it loads the environment variables into the `_environment_vars` dictionary.

        Retrieves the value of an environment variable by its key.

        Parameters
        ----------
        key : str
            The key of the environment variable to retrieve.

        Returns
        -------
        str
            The value of the environment variable.

        Raises
        ------
        KeyError
            If the environment variable does not exist.
