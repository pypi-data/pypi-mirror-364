class IPath(ABC):
    """
    A facade class for resolving absolute paths to various application directories.

    This class provides static methods to resolve paths to common directories such as
    'app', 'config', 'database', 'resources', 'routes', 'storage', and 'tests'.
    It uses the `PathService` to resolve and validate paths.

    Methods
    -------
    _resolve_directory(directory: str, file: str = None) -> SkeletonPath
        Resolves the absolute path for a given directory and optional file.
    app(file: str = None) -> SkeletonPath
        Returns the absolute path for a file inside the 'app' directory.
    config(file: str = None) -> SkeletonPath
        Returns the absolute path for a file inside the 'config' directory.
    database(file: str = None) -> SkeletonPath
        Returns the absolute path for a file inside the 'database' directory.
    resource(file: str = None) -> SkeletonPath
        Returns the absolute path for a file inside the 'resource' directory.
    routes(file: str = None) -> SkeletonPath
        Returns the absolute path for a file inside the 'routes' directory.
    storage(file: str = None) -> SkeletonPath
        Returns the absolute path for a file inside the 'storage' directory.
    tests(file: str = None) -> SkeletonPath
        Returns the absolute path for a file inside the 'tests' directory.
