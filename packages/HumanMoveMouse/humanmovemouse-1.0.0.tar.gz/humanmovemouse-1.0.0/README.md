## Overview

**HumanMoveMouse** is a human-like mouse automation tool built on over **300 real human mouse movement samples**.

By extracting key statistical features from these trajectories and combining them with minimum-jerk interpolation, the tool enables the generation of natural, smooth, and realistic cursor paths.

These paths closely mimic real human behavior and are ideal for automation tasks requiring authenticity, such as UI testing, game botting, or user behavior simulation.

---

## Features

- **Human-like Trajectory Generation**: Generates mouse paths that follow human-like patterns based on a real-data model.

- **Multiple Mouse Actions**: Supports various common operations, including moving, clicking, double-clicking, right-clicking, and dragging.

- **Highly Customizable**:
  
  - **Speed Control**: Adjust movement speed via the `speed_factor` parameter.
  
  - **Trajectory Smoothness**: Control the number of points in the trajectory with the `num_points` parameter.
  
  - **Jitter Effect**: Add random jitter to make movements more realistic with the `jitter_amplitude` parameter.

- **Reproducibility**: By setting a random seed (`seed`), you can generate the exact same mouse trajectory, which is useful for debugging and testing.

- **Pre-trained Model**: Includes a model trained on real human mouse movements for immediate use.

## Installation

You can install the package directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install HumanMoveMouse
```

---

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from humanmouse import HumanMouseController

# Create a controller instance
controller = HumanMouseController()

# Move the mouse
controller.move((100, 100), (800, 600))

# Move and click
controller.move_and_click((100, 100), (400, 400))

# Move and double-click
controller.move_and_double_click((400, 400), (600, 300))

# Drag and drop
controller.drag((300, 300), (500, 500))
```

### Using Current Mouse Position

```python
# New methods that start from current mouse position
controller.move_to((800, 600))              # Move from current position
controller.click_at((400, 400))             # Move and click
controller.double_click_at((600, 300))      # Move and double-click
controller.right_click_at((500, 500))       # Move and right-click
controller.drag_to((300, 300))              # Drag from current position
```

### Customizing Movement Parameters

```python
# Create controller with custom parameters
controller = HumanMouseController(
    num_points=200,           # More points = smoother movement
    jitter_amplitude=0.2,     # Less jitter = straighter path
    speed_factor=0.5          # Slower movement
)

# Set speed dynamically
controller.set_speed(2.0)  # Double speed
controller.move((100, 100), (800, 600))
```

## API Reference

### HumanMouseController

#### `__init__(self, model_pkl=None, num_points=100, jitter_amplitude=0.3, speed_factor=1.0)`

Initialize the controller.

**Parameters:**
- `model_pkl` (str, optional): Path to a custom model file. If None, uses the built-in model.
- `num_points` (int): Number of trajectory points. Higher = smoother. Default: 100.
- `jitter_amplitude` (float): Random jitter magnitude. 0 = no jitter. Default: 0.3.
- `speed_factor` (float): Movement speed multiplier. >1 = faster, <1 = slower. Default: 1.0.

#### `move(self, start_point, end_point, seed=None)`

Move the mouse from start to end point.

**Parameters:**
- `start_point` (tuple): Starting coordinates (x, y).
- `end_point` (tuple): Target coordinates (x, y).
- `seed` (int, optional): Random seed for reproducible trajectories.

#### `move_and_click(self, start_point, end_point, seed=None)`

Move to a location and perform a single click.

#### `move_and_double_click(self, start_point, end_point, seed=None)`

Move to a location and perform a double click.

#### `move_and_right_click(self, start_point, end_point, seed=None)`

Move to a location and perform a right click.

#### `drag(self, start_point, end_point, seed=None)`

Drag from start to end point (press and hold left button).

#### `set_speed(self, speed_factor)`

Dynamically adjust movement speed.

**Parameters:**
- `speed_factor` (float): New speed multiplier (must be > 0).

### Methods Starting from Current Position

#### `move_to(self, end_point, seed=None)`

Move from current mouse position to target position.

**Parameters:**
- `end_point` (tuple): Target coordinates (x, y).
- `seed` (int, optional): Random seed for reproducible trajectories.

#### `click_at(self, end_point, seed=None)`

Move from current position to target and perform a single click.

#### `double_click_at(self, end_point, seed=None)`

Move from current position to target and perform a double click.

#### `right_click_at(self, end_point, seed=None)`

Move from current position to target and perform a right click.

#### `drag_to(self, end_point, seed=None)`

Drag from current position to target (press and hold left button).

## Advanced Usage

### Using Custom Models

If you have a custom-trained model file, you can load it:

```python
controller = HumanMouseController(model_pkl="path/to/your/model.pkl")
```

### Training Your Own Model

For training custom models with your own mouse movement data, please refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TomokotoKiyoshi/HumanMoveMouse) which includes:
- Data collection tools
- Model training scripts
- Complete development environment
