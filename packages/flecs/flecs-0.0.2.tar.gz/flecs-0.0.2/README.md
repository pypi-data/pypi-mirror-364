# flecs

pybind11 bindings for [flecs](https://www.flecs.dev/flecs/)

The bindings are mainly designed for rapid prototyping in Python of ECS oriented software architectures for AI.
The syntax aims to be Pythonic with implict defaults, and the focus is on supporting arbitrary Python types as components rather than optimized performance.

Checkout the examples/ folder, which contains a subset of some critical flecs example with the new syntax.
