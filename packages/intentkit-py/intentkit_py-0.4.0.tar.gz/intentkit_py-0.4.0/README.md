## What is Intent Kit?

Intent Kit helps you build AI-powered applications that understand what users want and take the right actions. Think of it as a smart router that can:

- **Understand user requests** using any AI model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or your own)
- **Extract important details** like names, dates, and preferences automatically
- **Take actions** like sending messages, making calculations, or calling APIs
- **Handle complex requests** that involve multiple steps
- **Keep track of conversations** so your app remembers context

The best part? You stay in complete control. You define exactly what your app can do and how it should respond.

---

## Why Intent Kit?

### 🎯 **You're in Control**
Define every possible action upfront. No surprises, no unexpected behavior.

### 🚀 **Works with Any AI**
Use OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, or even simple rules. Mix and match as needed.

### 🔧 **Easy to Build**
Simple, clear API that feels natural to use. No complex abstractions to learn.

### 🧪 **Testable & Reliable**
Built-in testing tools let you verify your workflows work correctly before deploying.

### 📊 **See What's Happening**
Visualize your workflows and track exactly how decisions are made.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Intent Kit

```bash
pip install intentkit-py
```

For AI features, add your preferred provider:
```bash
pip install 'intentkit-py[openai]'    # OpenAI
pip install 'intentkit-py[anthropic]'  # Anthropic
pip install 'intentkit-py[all]'        # All providers
```

### 2. Build Your First Workflow

```python
from intent_kit import IntentGraphBuilder, action, llm_classifier

# Define what your app can do
greet = action(
    name="greet",
    description="Greet the user by name",
    action_func=lambda name: f"Hello {name}!",
    param_schema={"name": str}
)

weather = action(
    name="weather",
    description="Get weather for a location",
    action_func=lambda city: f"Weather in {city}: 72°F, Sunny",
    param_schema={"city": str}
)

# Create a classifier to understand user requests
classifier = llm_classifier(
    name="main",
    children=[greet, weather],
    llm_config={"provider": "openai", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo"}
)

# Build your workflow
graph = IntentGraphBuilder().root(classifier).build()

# Test it!
result = graph.route("Hello Alice")
print(result.output)  # → "Hello Alice!"
```

### 3. Try More Examples

```python
# Get weather
result = graph.route("What's the weather in San Francisco?")
print(result.output)  # → "Weather in San Francisco: 72°F, Sunny"

# Handle multiple requests
result = graph.route("Greet Bob and check weather in NYC")
print(result.output)  # → Handles both requests!
```

---

## How It Works

Intent Kit uses a simple but powerful pattern:

1. **Actions** - Define what your app can do (send messages, make API calls, etc.)
2. **Classifiers** - Understand what the user wants using AI or rules
3. **Graphs** - Connect everything together into a workflow
4. **Context** - Remember conversations and user preferences

The magic happens when a user sends a message:
- The classifier figures out what they want
- Intent Kit extracts the important details (names, locations, etc.)
- The right action runs with those details
- You get back a response

---

## Real-World Testing

Most AI frameworks are black boxes that are hard to test. Intent Kit is different.

### Test Your Workflows Like Real Software

```python
from intent_kit.evals import run_eval, load_dataset

# Load test cases
dataset = load_dataset("tests/greeting_tests.yaml")

# Test your workflow
result = run_eval(dataset, graph)

print(f"Accuracy: {result.accuracy():.1%}")
result.save_report("test_results.md")
```

### What You Can Test

- **Accuracy** - Does your workflow understand requests correctly?
- **Performance** - How fast does it respond?
- **Edge Cases** - What happens with unusual inputs?
- **Regressions** - Catch when changes break existing functionality

This means you can deploy with confidence, knowing your AI workflows work reliably.

## Development & Contribution

### Pre-commit Hooks & Version Management

This project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and version consistency:

- **Version Sync:** The version in `pyproject.toml` is automatically synced to `intent_kit/__init__.py` on commit.
- **Changelog Check:** Commits are blocked if the current version is not present in `CHANGELOG.md`.

To set up pre-commit hooks:

```bash
uv pip install pre-commit
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Build, Test, and Lint

All development tasks use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, reproducible Python workflows.

- **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  uv sync --group dev
  ```
- **Run tests:**
  ```bash
  uv run pytest
  ```
- **Lint:**
  ```bash
  uv run lint
  uv run black --check .
  uv run typecheck
  ```
- **Build package:**
  ```bash
  uv build
  ```

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

- **CI:** Lint, typecheck, test, and evaluate using `uv` in GitHub Actions.
- **Deploy:** On new tags, the package is built and published to PyPI, and documentation is deployed to Cloudflare Pages. (Publishing is handled by maintainers via CI/CD.)

### Utility Scripts
