              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

# PAIG Client Library

The `paig_client` library allows you to seamlessly integrate Privacera AI Governance into your Langchain projects. 

This README provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up and use the library.

## Installation

You can install the `paig_client` library using `pip`:

```shell
pip3 install paig_client
```

## Initialization
Start your PAIG-Server. Create your AI application and 
download the Shield Configuration file. Place the file in a folder called `privacera` relative to 
where you are running the app.

```python
# Import paig_client
import paig_client.client

# Setup Privacera Shield
paig_client.client.setup(frameworks=["langchain"])
```

## Usage
Once you have completed the setup of paig_client, you can set the user in the context 
for Privacera Shield to use.

### Using context manager

```python
import paig_client.client

paig_client.client.setup(frameworks=["langchain"])

# Set the current user_name in the context
try:
    with paig_client.client.create_shield_context(username="user"):
        response = llm_chain.run(prompt_text)
except paig_client.exception.AccessControlException as e:
    # If access is denied, then this exception will be thrown. You can handle it accordingly.
    print(f"AccessControlException: {e}")
```

# Completed example using OpenAI

```python
import os

import paig_client.client
import paig_client.exception

from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") # 

# Initialize Privacera Shield
paig_client.client.setup(frameworks=["langchain"])

llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=api_key)
template = """Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step."""
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["question"])

# Let's assume the user is "testuser"
user = "testuser"
prompt_text = "Who is first President of USA and where did they live?"
llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)
try:
   with paig_client.client.create_shield_context(username=user):
      response = llm_chain.run(prompt_text)
      print(f"LLM Response: {response}")
except paig_client.exception.AccessControlException as e:
   # If access is denied, then this exception will be thrown. You can handle it accordingly.
   print(f"AccessControlException: {e}")

```

### Additional ways of passing the application config file to set up Privacera Shield
- Place the file in ```privacera``` folder relative to where you are running the app
- Set the environment variable ```PRIVACERA_SHEILD_CONFIG_FILE``` to the path of the file
- Set the environment variable ```PRIVACERA_SHEILD_CONFIG_DIR``` to a folder that contains the file. Only one
  application config file should be present in the folder.
- Pass the file path as ```application_config_file``` parameter to the setup function
- Pass the string contents of the file to the setup function as ```application_config``` parameter
- Pass a dict by converting file contents which is in json format and pass to the setup function as 
  ```application_config``` parameter

### You can create multiple applications

If your application has multiple AI models to be governed, you can create multiple applications as follows:

```python
app1 = paig_client.client.setup_app(...)
app2 = paig_client.client.setup_app(...)
```
You can pass the following parameters to the setup_app function:
- Pass the file path as ```application_config_file``` parameter to the setup function
- Pass the string contents of the file to the setup function as ```application_config``` parameter
- Pass a dict by converting file contents which is in json format and pass to the setup function as 
  ```application_config``` parameter

And then you can pass the application object to the context manager as follows:

```python
with paig_client.client.create_shield_context(appplication=app1, username="user"):
    response = llm_chain.run(prompt_text)
```

Note that you still need to invoke the privacera.client.setup() method before calling the 
privacera.client.setup_app(...) method.
