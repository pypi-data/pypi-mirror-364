.SH DESCRIPTION
.I xxd
creates a hex dump of a given file or standard input.
It can also convert a hex dump back to its original binary form.
Like
.BR uuencode(1)
and
.BR uudecode(1)
it allows the transmission of binary data in a `mail-safe' ASCII representation,
but has the advantage of decoding to standard output.
Moreover, it can be used to perform binary file patching.
.SH OPTIONS
If no
.I infile
is given, standard input is read.
If
.I infile
is specified as a
.RB \` \- '
character, then input is taken from standard input.
If no
.I outfile
is given (or a
.RB \` \- '
character is in its place), results are sent to standard output
