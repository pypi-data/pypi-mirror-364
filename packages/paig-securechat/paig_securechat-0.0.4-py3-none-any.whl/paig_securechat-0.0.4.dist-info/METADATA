              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# PAIG Securechat 

Secure Chat is a conversational AI chatbot .
Secure chat allows users to create  conversations with an AI chatbot which can optionally be governed by PAIG. 
Secure chat library provides an easy to use, plugable platform which will allow developers/users to have open sourced chatbot python library.


## Contents
- [Installation](#Installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Configuration](#configuration)
- [Configure PAIG Shield Config](#shieldconfigure)


## Installation <a name="Installation"></a>
PAIG Secure chat is a python library which can be installed using pip.
```bash
pip install paig_securechat
```

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
PAIG Secure chat can be used in following ways:
1. Before starting the securechat, you need to create a PAIG application and generate an API key for the application.
   - To create a new application and generate an API key, follow these steps:
     
     - Login to PAIG.
     - Go to `Paig Navigator` → `AI Applications` and click the `CREATE APPLICATION` button at the top-right.
     - A dialog box will open where you can enter the details of your application.
     - Once the Application is created:
       
       - Navigate to `Paig Navigator` → `AI Applications` and select the application for which you want to generate the API key.
       - In the `API KEYS` tab, click the `GENERATE API KEY` button in the top-right corner.
       - Provide a `Name` and `Description`, and set an `Expiry`, or select the `Max Validity (1 year)` checkbox to use the default expiry.

       > **Note:** Once the API key is generated, it will not be shown again. Ensure you copy and securely store it immediately after generation.

   - To initialize the **PAIG Shield** library in your SecureChat application, export the `PAIG_APP_API_KEY` as an environment variable:

     ```bash
     export PAIG_APP_API_KEY=<<AI_APPLICATION_API_KEY>>
     ```

     **OR**  
     Create a file called `paig.key` in the `custom-configs` folder and save the AI Application API key in it:

     ```bash
     echo "<<AI_APPLICATION_API_KEY>>" > custom-configs/paig.key
     ```
2. **Run as a service:** You can simply run the secure chat as a service by running following command:
 ```bash
paig_securechat run
 ```
To get the help for the command and see all available [OPTIONS], you can run the following command:
```bash
paig_securechat --help
```
Example:
```bash
paig_securechat run --port 2324 --host 0.0.0.0 --openai_api_key <API_KEY> 
```
3. **Run as a library:** You can run PAIG Secure chat in background by importing the library in your python code.
Please run help command to see all available options you can pass while calling launch_app method.
```python
from paig_securechat import launcher
# Start the PAIG Secure Chatbot
session = launcher.launch_app()
# To start without PAIG Shield
# session = launcher.launch_app(disable_paig_shield_plugin=True)
# To get active sessions
active_session = launcher.get_active_session()
print(active_session)
# To view the chatbot in the browser/Iframe
print(active_session.url)
# To view the chatbot in the Iframe
active_session.view()
# To stop the chatbot
launcher.close_app()
```
> [!NOTE]
> We recommend to use PAIG Shield config for governance of the chatbot.You can opt for insecure mode by providing the `--disable_paig_shield_plugin` flag while running the chatbot. You can pass this option in launch_app method as well.

## Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>
PAIG Secure chat provides overlay configuration. You can provide the custom configuration in the following ways:
1. Create a new directory in the present working directory of the project with the name `custom-configs`.
2. Create a new custom configuration file named `standalone_config.yaml` in the `custom-configs` folder which is provided to the application.
3. In custom configuration file , user should provide new configuration key-values or override the existing configuration.
4. User can configure `response_if_no_docs_found` to provide a custom response when vector DB return no docs, If user want response from AI Model then set `response_if_no_docs_found` to `null`
<br>Example: `custom-configs/standalone_config.yaml`
```yaml
#MODELS CONFIG
AI_applications:
  file_path: "configs/AI_applications.json"
  default_implementation_class: "services.OpenAI_Application.OpenAIClient.OpenAIClient"
  response_if_no_docs_found: "I cannot answer this question as there was no context provided"
  sales_model:
    conversation_history_k: 5
    paig_shield_config_file: "custom-configs/privacera-shield-config.json"
    disable_conversation_chain: false
    vectordb:
      index_path: "securechat/sales/index"
      data_path: "securechat/sales/data"
      vector_type: "chroma"
```

## Configure PAIG Shield Config <a name="shieldconfigure"></a>
PAIG SecureChat provides an option to configure the PAIG Shield Config.
You can refer to standalone_config.yaml to see location of the shield config file.
All you need to do is to copy PAIG Shield Config file to the location mentioned in the standalone_config.yaml file.
